Of the ones I have witnessed this one was different. He was sitting down reclined when he informed me he had feelings of déjà vu. I began watching and observing him. His head went down and his eyes rolled to the back of his head. He let out a groan and his arms straightened and fists clenched. His arms and head starting flailing. After about 2 minutes he was returning to his senses feeling very nauseous and dizzy. Prior to this evening he has been seen by a neurologist and all the scans and tests that he has been given have come back normal and they said unless it happened it front of them they didn’t know what to say. Is there anything that I can do to help him with this or is he just stuck having these for the rest of his life not knowing what’s going on?","question"

He was weaned off Keppra after two years and had a breakthrough seizure. Then he was put onto another anti seizure medication and had a severe allergic reaction to it. He has been on Keppra again exclusively for the past 8 months. His behavior is hard to describe. Before Keppra he was a happy, fun-loving, calm kid. Now he can only be described as disrespectful, disobedient, argumentative, rude and sometimes enraged. Hence ‘Keppra rage.’ He finally being weaned off Keppra and onto Vimpat. We pray that this is the answer. What happened to our silly, fun-loving, laid-back boy? Any idea that this is “just teenage hormones” is completely misguided.

My dad is 63 years old, a survivor of 2 cardiac arrests, a stroke 5 years ago that was accompanied by a seizure. On Saturday he wasn't feeling well with a headache and then became unresponsive. He had a seizure in the ambulance and one in the ER. He was on life support for almost 2 days and thank goodness is is now awake and alert. His memory is very touch and go. He has come along way. He couldn't remember the names of his children at first but he still has trouble following conversation and he still hears things or says things that don't make sense. He has all of his physical facilities. He had a CT scan that came back normal and two MRIs that showed inflammation on his left temporal lobe. His phosphorus levels were low on admission. He was on video EEG for four days and had many focal seizures, during which he saw things that weren't there and lost his depth of perception. He hasn't had a seizure that the EEG could register for 48 hours after adjusting his medication. His vision changes sometimes. He will see everything as normal and then everything will be all shades of blue, or brown, or yellow. Sometimes he says the colors don't change they just get super bright. He has continued to have a low grade fever since before his initial seizure on Friday. His spinal tap was negative for meningitis. And there is no indication of an infection based on his blood tests. The hospital wants to send him home without a diagnosis even though they say his inflammation continues to spread. They have confirmed it is not from a stroke and they are now sending a sample of his spinal tap off to be testing for any autoimmune disease because we are requesting it. They have also confirmed it is not from damage from his previous stroke because that was on the other side of his brain. Has anyone ever had a similar situation? Please help me help him.","question"

Instead of trying to just put me on two different types of tablets and try that, my neurologist thought it would be wise to use me as a guinea pig and put me on four different ones.

This past Thanksgiving,  he had a total of 5 seizures over 24 hours necessitating a hospital visit and stay. They put him on a third seizure medication (Lamotrigine). I spoke with a neurologist at USF who didn't like that a 3rd medication was added before his previous two were maxed out--he was already on Keppra (max dosage) and Depakote (sprinkles--very low dose), so she titrated him up on the Depakote so we could get rid of the Lamotrigine. Well, that worked. He's now on Keppra and Depakote only, we dropped the Lamotrigine a few months ago. His Depakote dose is currently 1000mg in the AM and 1500mg PM. The good news is that his seizures seem to have stopped--no seizures since Thanksgiving (7 months, the longest he has gone without)--but recently had complained to me about being ""bald"" so when I was helping him wash his hair, I did notice that his hair, which was once extremely thick, almost to the point of too thick, is now very thin and, while no actual ""bald"" spots, it is very thin on the top of his head. I started giving him collagen supplements to hopefully help with the hair growth again but it's only been about a week and hasn't kicked in yet. Is this really a side effect?

I want to live my life fully, and I now understand that antidepressants are probably going to be part of my life for the foreseeable future.  I apparently used up all my good brain chemicals in the past--I don't have a reserve any more--and so I may have to take antidepressants for the rest of my life.  I'm lucky, because I've found one that works for me (many people have to trial several different meds to find one that works for them).  But I'm also lucky, because I've had good care, and I know that 'slipping into depression' is not a choice--it's a chemical reaction.  So, if you're taking a medication for epilepsy and you are depressed while taking it, or even when you're not taking it, there is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING for which to ""blame"" yourself.  And if you choose not to take antidepressants, there is still nothing to blame yourelf for if you're depressed; you're trying to make do with the cards that you've been dealt.  You can't do anything to change your height or skin tone or IQ; why would you think you could change your emotional makeup?Please don't add guilt to your other problems.  No matter how positive your thoughts, you can't change the fact that you have hypertension, or irritable bowel disease, or athlete's foot, or anything else.  Maybe for a short period of time, you can ignore the symptoms with ""positive thoughts"" and there are no doubt people who will come out of the woodwork who will give you (and me) testimonials regarding how they cured their type 1 diabetes or cancer or epilepsy or depression with those positive thoughts, but you and I are not those people, we do not have their past histories, and their reality doesn't really have anything to do with ours, and neither does their chemical makeup.  We're all different.  For instance, some people with type 1 diabetes, like my husband, are lucky enough to take their insulin twice a day, without adhering to a strict diabetic diet, and they're doing just fine.  Other people are totally committed to that strict diet, exercise regularly, think positive thoughts, and yet their diabetes is 'brittle' or relatively uncontrollable.  Some people have had one horrible thing to contend with in life, some of us had have multiple horrendous happenings to deal with; some people are thought of as superhumanly strong to have overcome hideous adversity, and some of us are thought of as weak and unable to overcome perhaps relatively smaller obstacles thrown in our paths.  But bottom line--we are individuals, we were all born with finite levels of seratonin, or insulin, or receptors in our brains that make us immune to epilepsy, or strong genetic makeups that don't predispose us to cancers, or urinary tract infections, or menstrual cramps.  Depression is no more a choice than any other physical malady.  Some positive thinking and lifestyle choices may affect any physical challenge transiently or partially, or in some cases it seems permanently.  But many challenges will remain unaffected by will or desire or prayer or assigning blame on oneself for the problem.  We only have ""control"" to a certain point, and feeling guilty because we can't control our bodies is pretty self-defeating.  We can't control sunrise or sunset, fall or spring, arm-span, or ears that grow as we age--so why do we think we can control mental aspects of our genetic makeup with ""positive"" thoughts?  You likely weren't looking for a lecture when you made your post, but I have had one of the most difficult days of my life and found this site and made my own post requesting feedback, and I couldn't resist addressing the fact that you might feel guilty for being depressed.  I realize that probably only three people in the entire world will read this, but I feel better for having said it.  I sincerely hope that you see this, and re-think your position regarding depression.I wish you peace,Mimisbigsis","answer"

Nothing cures it, except possibly surgery and that is problematic at best. Epilepsy is not a disease like the flu which is caused by an orgnism and can be removed/destroyed. It is a condition like diabetes which can be controlled but that will be done with medication. I've never heard of homeopthic/ayurvedic treatments for epilepsy, but I won't say they don't exist. However I suggest you be very skeptical. The risk of changing from something that works to something that may not is very high. This is your BRAIN we are taking about. If you damage it, you will have nothing left. A person can live a full and meaningfull life with epilepsy, if they are carefull to manage it. If they are not carefull, they can destroy that life.","answer"

Some history - when I was maybe 10 years old, I had my first episode of whatever this 'thing' was. I was in the gym jump rope skipping with some friends, when in mid conversation, just snapped into a dream like state. This was a terrifying experience and I can remember just feeling like there was a black haze around me and I could hear what was going on around me, but was either unable or too terrified to respond. I could see as well, but it seemed like everything was in slow motion. Over the years, this happened again several times, my main triggers were if I did not sleep well, or if I was in a crowd, such as a fair. I had a massive episode happen in grade 9, where I thought I was upstairs at school but was actually downstairs, and that somehow triggered the event which I thought I was completely in a dream, and was terrified when I realized that I wasn't. Just so strange. I never told a doctor about this until two years ago, as I thought they were panic attacks.So two years ago, I went to see a neurologist about dizziness and neck pain - I am a registered nurse so I figured it was work related. And I just casually mentioned these episodes that I had experienced as a child...he said nonchalantly 'oh yeah simple partial seizures'. But literally did not say anything else about it. I didn't really ask questions about it, because I had not experienced it in so long. He did an MRI which came back negative, except for a 4mm choroid plexus cyst in lateral ventricle trigone area of lateral horn, which he said was probably a choroid plexus cyst and to forget about it. He sent me on my way as I am normal and goodbye. I did have a repeat MRI in 2015 which was also the same.So this past week, I hit my head in the shower - hard, but not too hard - I did not lose consciousness, and the next day, I was walking around a busy Toronto street that I did not recognize, and I had another one of these episodes - the first one in years - where I just snapped into this dreamlike state. I usually have to pinch myself because I feel so light and airy, like I am not real. I should also mention that I tend to have dreams that come true, and sometimes feel that I am psychic. So naturally I am terrified and trying to determine if maybe I have had epilepsy my whole life??? Could this neurologist have missed something? Is it a tumor? Did hitting my head do anything?? Please any insight would be so helpful - nobody understands me ever so it is so nice to have all of you!","question"

My husband has been on Lamotrigine for a while now. On 7/30/2019 the brand of his lamotrigine was changed by the pharmacy from Zydus to Unichem. I asked the pharmacy if this would cause an issue and they stated they were the same. However, 21 days after starting this new brand he had a grandmal seizure in our car. We are grateful he is alive and was not injured. In addition no one else was hurt or injured. However 3 days later we realize this could have been avioded if his brand of Lamotrigine never would have been switched. Our car is totaled and we are having to deal with medical bills from the ER and the ambulance ride.Looking back we should have realized there was an issue. He had an anger spell only 10 days after being on the medicaiton and he was sleeping so much more often, plus he was itchy. At the time of these occurances I thought it was just life. He just woke up having a bad day, his work load was making him tired, and he was itchy because the dogs had fleas. My husband said he felt different but didnt think of the meds being the cause and didnt say nothing because he was scared to worry me to much.Now we have an agreement that he tells me when he experiences off feelings. The thing is though all our pain and anguish could have been avioded if the pharmacy would have said there was a possible difference. In addition I have researched and cant really do anything to hold the pharmacy, or the Pharmeutical company accountable. I have done the research though and found others that stated Lamortrigine by Unichem was not as effective and I even found a guy who had two grandma seizures. FDA says things like this are under reported.Does anyone relate to this story??? Is my husband and me the only one that feels like this is a fail of policy and procedures???","question"

The biggest thing is just letting him be a kid and doing things that he enjoys. I have learned not to ignore the seizures because we still have to keep him safe...but, to just not make a big deal out of it. We just wait it out and go on with what we were doing. I didn't realize that me hovering over him made it worse. He just wanted to be ""a normal"" kid.  I have noticed the more positive he is about things the fewer episodes he has. Attitude has alot to do it. (His and Mine). Lucky for him, he is really smart and makes A's and B's in AP classes. He has been able to keep up even though he has been out for several days at a time.

I have a new relationship with a guy who is now 32 years old.We had sex for the first time last week, and it really scared me. When he orgasmed, he started convulsing really violently, lost almost all control of all his muscles. He could barely move (he was kneeing on the floor), though he did try to not hit me by accident or something by turning his torso away from me. For all I could see, most of his muscles on his arms and legs where all bunched up, at first I thought he was having a major cramp or something.As far as I know, and as far as he told me, he is not a diagnosed epileptic, nor has he had any seizures like that before. He just told me that he experiences what his friends call ""multiple ejaculations"", and thus the convulsions etc. This has happened all the times we had sex so far though, all 6 of them. He admits afterwards that he is not conscious of his surroundings at that time, and that in the past he has accidentally hit a girl in the face while convulsing, though he did not remember it. He also hit his finger the other day and did not notice it until afterwards.I am familiar with epilepsy in general from other friends etc. This looks a lot to me like he's having a fit at the time of ejaculation. He told me he is not in any pain whatsoever.Can anyone tell me if such a thing is possible? Having an epileptic fit during ejaculation?Is there something I can do to help him?

Is it possible absolutley. Just because he doesnt have seizures because of lights means nothing. That just isnt a trigger to the seizures. It is very possible that because an orgasm can be so intense that it may trigger seiures for him. What you need is a neuroglogist to make sure that those are sizures. The next time it happens though you need to be careful. Alot of people after a seizure go through what they call a postictal period, which is them pretty much recovering from a seizure. They can get tired non responsive and sometimes lose their fuids in their body by peeing and bowels or also throw up. It is viatly important if in the middle of a seizure that you put his body on his side and move all dangerous odjects from around him. Time how long it last and what exactly his body does. This is also important for diagnosing if he has epilepsy and what side of the brain it may start at. Good luck and get the man to a Dr.good luck and keep us posted.","answer"

I've done it for years, I stay in top physical shape, and I've learned to control it fairly well. The first wave is still involuntary, but I can control all the following waves fairly well. I don't want to see a doctor; the orgasm is visceral, bestial, and absolutely incredible.","answer"

He was also diagnosed with autism at age 3. In the beginning, he had one or two a year. We tried various medications, but Keppra seemed to work the best for him. Fast forward to today, he’s still having them but more frequently, every 2 months or so. He is always hospitalized for 48-72 hours as more times than not, has to be put on a ventilator. After each episode, his Dr. increases his dosage and he’s now up to 5,500 mg a day. (That amount seems almost scary!!) We’ve noticed that as his dosages increase, he’s forgetful and just doesn’t have the “umph” that he used to. He’s currently living in a private community for adults with disabilities and taking classes and he’s just stopped going, or missing the majority of them each week. He’s always been one to follow instructions (almost to a fault), never acting out, etc. so we were not understanding this at first. We, along with his counselors talked to him and he always apologizes and says he’ll do better and it just doesn’t happen. When asked, he says he forgets?? His Dr. said that it is not the Keppra but we know something is going on. We’ve made an appointment to see a new neurologist who specializes in seizure disorders but am curious to know if anyone else might have or is experiencing these symptoms.","question"

My 9 year old son fell asleep on the couch on 15 January when I went in the room, he was vomitting while he was asleep, I tried to wake but he was unresponsive. He did not answer me he woke after about 3 minutes just staring not answering me, he eventually started responding to me, and cried and said his head is very sore as well as complained about his tummy hurting. We immediately took him to our GP and he injected him for the severe headache. All was fine then. We went to see a paediatrician and he referred us to a paediatric neurologist. She said after a clinically visit she don't think my child have epilepsy but severe migraines. He occasionally struggle with headaches and severe headache but never with seizure simptoms. She did a 16 hr EEG and a MRI. MRI just stated that he have a left choroidal cyst and everything otherwise looks normal. The EEG report said that there is a abnormality present. The neurologist could not give us a clear answer that if it was now epilepsy or not. She put him on Epilim syrup 5ml 3 times per day. In May he had a follow up EEG 16hr and once again it showed that a abnormality was present. Burst of sharp and slow waves from the right temporo parietal area. The bloodtest showed that his erythrocyte red blood cell count was high since February but there was also now hyperphosphatemia noted. The dr explained nothing to me as I could not afford her follow up fees. So I asked for reports and forwarded to my Paediatrician. I really need your input regarding this. My son was when he was 7 also fell asleep on the couch and suddenly came upright we asked him what was wrong and he also was unresponsive for 3 minutes both his eyes were opened just staring to the right. We did took him to ER but his vitals was good. So the neurologist say she think it is migraines and paediatrician say its epilepsy. I am confused and really need a answer.

I am a 30-year old man. I suffer from multiple sclerosis and also epilepsy, which is, they say, a result of the MS.I've had what I call ""mini seizures"" for over 10 years now, and one big one (grand mal) about two years ago.The smaller ones always manifest in the same manner, they would wake me up in the morning, I would get a sudden shock in my head, my heart starts racing like crazy, sometimes I got a sort of a strange taste of iron in my mouth, and before therapy I used to also get deja-vu symptoms and sometimes a twitch in my left arm. Those attacks were ignored by my MS doc, with the explanation that I have some kind of vasovagal syncope (?), and it took the grand mal for them to start taking treating me seriously for it.I was put on Depachine (valproat) 600 mg and Trileptal (oxcarbazepine) 600 mg. The deja-vu feeling after that was no more, and there was no more twitching, but despite upping the dose to the maximum I still get the heart-pounding and that sudden feeling in my head like a shock and like I will drop to the ground. So the attacks are less severe, but definitely still there.Sorry for the long intro, here are the questions for which I would love to hear your input. - my attacks happen regulary almost like clock work - about once a month. When I wake up with my heart pounding, I know that that day I will have about 10 of those episodes. On those days I don't,for instance, drive my car or bike and I try to avoid noisy places. On other days, though, I can guarantee that no seizure will happen. Is this normal? Anyone else have regular seizures like those and feels absolutely fine on other days?- is there a chance some other drug will work if a combination of two drugs isn't enough?- how important is it that therapy completely gets rid of seizures, even the smaller ones? My neuro kept upping my dose until I said I'm cured now, which is a lie, I'm feeling ALMOST fine . But I've decided that I can,at least for now, live with this partially efficient therapy, as long as it helps me not to lose conciusness.- finally, I am afraid of SUDEP. Does the fact that my epilepsy is not FULLY under control increase my chances of this sudden death thing?Thanks to anyone who reads, better yet responds, I know it's long but I've finally got around to asking this, I've been planning it for so long.Eddy","question"

There are many reported causes of epilepsy greatly improving or disappearing with magnesium supplementation. In a trial with 30 epileptics 450 mg of magnesium supplied daily successfully controlled seizures. Another study found that the lower the magnesium blood levels the more severe was the epilepsy. In most cases magnesium works best in combination with vitamin B6 and zinc. In sufficient concentrations, magnesium inhibits convulsions by limiting or slowing the spread of the electric discharge from an isolated group of brain cells to the rest of the brain. Animal studies show that even the initial burst of firing nerve cells that starts an epileptic attack can be suppressed with magnesium.""MAGNESIUM CHLORIDE for Health & Rejuvenation by Walter Lasthttp://www.health-science-spirit.com/magnesiumchloride.html","question"

I did not care at the time and let her raise my dose.Talking with my new neurologist who is the Newsome chair of epileptology and director of the Epilepsy Program told me that in short the therapeutic range is different for everyone. Back then my levels were low and now they are on the high side which he is not worried about it.Now I don't know why his doctor wants to up his dose but if you and him are concerned talk with him or her about it and then decide what you feel is in the best interest for his health.","answer"

I went through the TEMPORAL LOBECTOMY OP in 2003. Before, I used to have complex partial seizures, but after the op they changed to Epileptic Auras. I was convinced by nero iwas suffering with epilepsy, but last year I was so frustrated I went to a different hospital and found a brilliant neuro  who suggested an Ambulatory EEG (where I was monitored for 3 days) He received multiple symptoms in that time but because the EEG came up with no zig-zag lines on it and was flat he then told me it wasn't Epileptic Seizures but Pseudo seizures which are caused by several traumatic events in your life.So I was told by my last Neuro that it was still epilepsy for 10 years. After I had a read up about things and it stated that 3 quarters of people who suffer with NON EPILEPTIC ATTACK DISORDER or pseudo seizures are put onto AEDs which your not supposed to take with NEAD, cos It  can give you harmful effects. The answer to suffering with NEAD is to see a PSYCHOTHERAPIST or have Counselling speak out to get to the route of your traumas. At present I am having it but has been upsetting at times, but its better out than in. Just try and find a good neurologist who has been in the game for several years, cos there are so many people suffering and receiving the wrong treatment, like myself for 10 years. Im giving you the advice because im concerned about your wife when you said some say its pseudo seizures and others are saying Epilepsy. Make sure you look into it and fire some qus at the doctors. She will find out if asked to have Ambulatory EEG on head cos then she would be monitored for about 3 days and if sezures came out flat on EEG you would know it is NOT that dreaded epilepsy.

She has seizures almost every month during her period. Also, whenever she gets sick or doesn't get enough sleep, or whenever she feels weak it's probable that she will experience a seizure.-She lost consciousness during seizures, but she doesn't lose control of her sphincters, seizures last between a few minutes to being confused with an epileptic status. -She is 28 years old and has been having seizures since 2006 (8 years).-Doctors haven't been able to differentiate between organic seizures (epilepsia) or conversion disorder (pseudo-seizures).- IRM studies show no anomaly in her head.- Doctors differ in their EEG interpretation some say that it is normal (no organic reason) and others argue that there is abnormal activity in her left parietal lobe.-Final diagnosis from doctors is that she may have both kind of seizures. Some of them would have organic reasons and other would be pseudo-seizures.-She has been prescribed with Levetiracetam, Magnesium Valproate and Topiramate but after using them for more than one year no change has been found in the seizures timing.- Right now she is being treated with Clonazepam and Citalopram, she has being using them for around one year with no change in seizures timing but with a better quality of life.-We have studies from 2006 -2014 (EEG and IRM) and we would be glad to share them with other people and doctors to help with diagnosis.We have been looking for the right diagnosis because seizures keep coming and we want to use the less medication possible in order to improve our quality of life.

Through the years, it has affected his mood greatly.

As a drug it does work well yet it has so many terrible side effects.  I took it from the time I was 12 and into my 30's.  I lived like a zombie for many a day and when I took it with phenobarbital it was impossible.   The newer drugs from Japan and Keppra are great.  Keppra can make me a little moody but I find when I eat alot of fruit or take a b6 pill I am fine.  Dilantin is a terrible drug that can turn your intelligence into mush.  Granted, it does work for the most part but there is a real price taking 400 mg/day.   One must take it based on body weight for it to truly function.  It lasts in the body for some time  ...about 24 hours and blood levels should be taken.Other drugs such as Keppra are more forgiving but its not for all types of seizures.   Depakote can be a replacement for Dilantin for some as can Zonegran. Neurologists can only guess on what drug will work and its up to you to give him/her good feedback.   When I was going to grammar school and high school I was taking Dilantin and phenobarbital and most days I was not totally myself.  It was hard to sit in class and not sleep.  I found myself drinking coffee to stay awake which of course is not an ideal thing.   Today, we have drugs that can do the job and not place us in some walking coma.  Children must be given options other than going through life sleep walking.  I was lucky (if you want to call it that) as they found a cyst that was causing my seizures.  I still will have one every 1 to 2 years but not as I did in my youth.    Remember...Dilantin is NOT an ideal medication and should only be used when all others will not work.","answer"

"My gf was smoking weed and had a seizure and heres what happened","https://www.medhelp.org/posts/Epilepsy/My-gf-was-smoking-weed-and-had-a-seizure-and-heres-what-happened/show/2967410","Burryahurr","2017-03-20T23:48:57-04:00","Okay so first off. My girlfriend is 16 years old and has smoked probably only about 10 or 20 times in her life. She hadnt smoked for like 3 months when we smoked. Now before u say anything. WE DID NOT SMOKE SPICE OR K2. I smoked this weed with so many people and everyone acted fine. The day before me and my girlfriend smoked she had not eaten a lot and missed dinner and didnt drink any water. She has a lot of stress in her life and the night before we smoked went through a huge argument/fight with her parents. She was woken up the next morning at 8 am by her mom saying ""your 2 best friends are in the hospital they were in a car wreck and are in horrible condition"" she didnt drink any water this day and ate 1 taco. Thats all. Obviously the hospital and the night before and her life at this time was super stressfull, plus she bearly ate in the last 15 or so hours and had bearly any water. Right after she left the hospital she went to my house. We usually cant smoke but my parents werent home so we did. I had a pretty big blunt because i put 2 rillos together. There was about 2 grams in it. It want burning super good so we were taking many hits that were kind of smaller hits so i feel like she maybe had less oxygen in her body. Anyway, we were over halfway through with the blunt and she goes ""...woah... I dont feel good"" immediately after hitting the blunt once. She falls kind of and has a small faint but never really like fully fainted, she just says she was super woozy and every sound was super muffled and she couldnt see right and everything was blurry. She scared me a lot and randomly was like stand up w me and i held her and she was like ""i cant stand..."" and slowly passed out in my srms. Immediately when i felt all her weight on me i knew she was unconcious i slowly put her down. Halfway through putting her down she began to have a seizure. Her muscles spasmed her back was arched, neck bent back, mouth was making weird noises not too violent though, her eyes were fluttering and she just looked like she was having a seizure. She stopped shaking but still had a look in her face of ""im still in seizure mode"" and then came back to reality about 10 sec later. She wasnt really in reality though. She was talking all weird and could only lay down and didnt seem to know what happened. I was crying and she was like ""why are you crying?"" And she had no emotion at all except happiness every few seconds. Shed smile and tell me i was handsome, stare in the sky and it felt like she was only registering half of what i said. She said she was zoning out and remembers some stuff afyer the seizure but not it all. She remembes everything like 30 min after the seizure happened thoigh. Anyways i just sat with her until she felt ok and then 30 min later we went inside and watched tv. I asked her about what happened snd told her and she was lostening but it still didnt see like she understood what eas going on. Remember: after the seizure she was not sad or snything she was perfectly fine. Then about an hour later when she was pretty much fully with me, she understood everything and realized why i was crying and hoe much she scared me. Before she did not know this. Anyway what she remembers is the beginning when she first fainted and she remmeberd after the seizure me crying and like she was zoning out at the clouds and like wasnt really fully with me and at first told me it wasnt real life. What ive looked up is that weed apparently can cause seizures if you havent eaten or drinken in a while and if the THC percentage in the weed is very high. She swears she was fine and then after she took liek her 15 or 20th hit or so of the pretty big blunt she immediately felt crazy and lost hearing and fainted somewhat and saw all blurry. Obviously her blood sugar and stuff was low and i read that can cause seizures too. I also read about vasovagal syncope but it doesnt seem like thats what it was because it doens say that causes seizures. I am just really scared and am looking for input. Main info is basically: 16 yr old girl, hadnt smoked in months, smoked a lot, hadnt eaten ( she had 1 taco for breakfast and missed dinner the nigt before, it was like 2pm at the time) or drinken water in a long time, very stressed, suddenly after her 20th or so hit felt like she was gonna faint, 30 seconds later she did faint and had a seizure that lasted about 30 or so seconds maybe a lil longer, then had a good 30 min episode of major confusion and total... how do i say... she jusy wasnt there. She didnt know what was going on and when i was telling her didnt seem like she was processing it. She felt weird the rest of the day and had light muscle spasms and didnt fully realize everything till a good hour after her seizure/fainting epidemic. Will answer any questions... sorry for the long post... just a scared boyfriend in love wanting to know what happened to my baby","question"

She was left with a brain injury as a result. She was a very promising swimmer prior to her illness and despite everything she has been through, she was back in the pool training and competing again within three months of her illness. She continued to perform well and last year gained a scholarship for swimming to a top school in the UK. Unfortunately she was recently diagnosed with epilepsy as a result of the brain injury she acquired. She immediately started taking Carbamazepine (Tegratol) 300mg twice daily. She has been on the drug for three months and has remained seizure free which we are so thankful for. She has gained a bit of weight but is not experiencing any other side effects. However, since starting the drug she has struggled with her swim performance. As she is also starting puberty, I am unsure if the weight gain and her swim performance is related to this or as a result of the medication. As epilepsy is also new to us we are unsure if the condition itself once treated effects sports performance. Has anyone got experience of taking this drug whilst taking part in competitive sport.J","question"

(In hindsight I really regret this because recreational abuse of medical marijuana, especially in California, has put many patients at risk of losing this vital medicine.) I was on Paxil to treat chronic pain at the time (very experimental treatment for pain, and there are now a couple other antidepressants that are vastly preferred for treating chronic pain). I'd missed my dose of Paxil the night before and made it up late that afternoon. My friend and I ate the brownie then settled in to watch a movie.Midway through I suddenly realized my whole body was twitching in these strange, jerky movements. When I tried to sit up, I couldn't move, and when I told my friend what was happening, my voice was stilted because my jaw and throat were jerking too. He called an ambulance, and many antics ensued from there. But the ridiculously conservative doctor told me (really yelled) I shouldn't do drugs and left it at that. (It was quite ridiculous because this was a city where people smoked openly in the street and the cops didn't care. Bigger fish to fry was kinda their policy. From the doctor's accent, I could tell he was from somewhere in the South and clearly had never heard the expression ""when in Rome."") I continued to have jerks here and there, at first constantly for a few weeks, and then slowly diminishing over a few YEARS.I ultimately followed up with a neurologist who diagnosed me with serotonin syndrome. Paxil is a very powerful SSRI, and with all the options available now, it tends to be a last resort. Our best understanding is that there were dangerously high levels of serotonin already in my brain (and I always had pretty severe withdrawals when I missed a dose), and when those levels became unbalanced and combined with a very powerful strain of marijuana, it induced what's called a myoclonic seizure. (Know that jerky feeling you get sometimes as you're falling asleep or waking up? That's called myoclonus. It's your body holding your body still so you don't hurt yourself in your sleep. But you're NOT supposed to have them when you're awake, and certainly not nonstop all over your body.) It's possible that the seizure had nothing to do with the Paxil and was brought on by that particular strain of marijuana, but it's unlikely in that particular situation.Here's the problem: when using (eating, smoking, vaping) marijuana recreationally, we don't know what we're getting. And while it's one of the least dangerous drugs in existence, far safer than alcohol and many, many prescription meds), the lack of regulation and information about what you're getting that's a result of its illegality leads to all kinds of problems. You don't know what strain you're getting, you don't know if it's laced with something, you don't know how it will interact with any pharmaceuticals, over the counter or prescription, that you're taking. So it's possible the marijuana itself caused your seizure (and you should verify with a doctor what KIND of seizure you had) because of the particular strain or what it was laced with, because of a particular predisposition you have, because of a drug interaction, or any other myriad variables. And it's possible it was a coincidence. Humans instinctively look for patterns, and often we end up finding ones that aren't really there. It's the fallacy of post hoc ergo propter hoc: ""after therefore because of."" Just because one event follows another, that doesn't mean the first event caused the second.In states and countries where marijuana is legal, recreationally and/or medically, there are fewer of these problems. When people are able to operate in the open, they can provide good information about what they're selling, and doctors can speak honestly about potential interactions and other ill effects. Just as some foods can kill some people and so we require labeling, some people react adversely to different strains of marijuana or unknown additives.Because of this, I will never consume it in a state/country where it's illegal and thus operating under the radar again. Even though it could probably drastically help with my now debilitating pain without the awful side effects I've had from various pharmaceuticals, I can't risk the unknown variables.","answer"

I originally started writing this and when I finished i looked back on it and I apologize. It's time for somebody to be honest. and I hope I don't leave anything out in the process of writing this, as everytime I read a thread, I see things and somebody's leaving something out or halfway b/sing you along the way. But I'm going to be honest as you should be too be cuz that's where it all starts, in that doctors office with that first sentence of either the truth, or the bull **** coming out of your mouth. I was that 17 year old that woke up on my mother's couch quacking like a duck, snapping my fingers, pointing at her with my 5 year old brother staring at my like oh my god what is wrong with my big brother. All because I made the decision the weeks and weeks before to stay up all night and party. Whether it was the alcohol, or the cocaine, it didn't matter at that point. The worse thing for anybody at any age to do is to cold turkey, STOP anything on their own. And then to go into a doctors office and not have the balls to fess up to your sins is the next worse thing to do. Beyond that every person is different in a sense of the medication and the amount of medication you're going to need. Even before you start thinking about medicine you need to think about the way you're going to live. Everyday... is going to be the same. You might think it's a big joke but you now have a very small window to play with here. I'm talking 1-2 hours, 3s pushing it, where you're days are exactly the same. You are waking up at the same time, you are eating at the same time, you are not driving in the dark, you are being questioned everytime you get that blank stare, even if you're just thinking really hard, you are not playing video games at 9pm with your kids and you are home back in bed in time to take your meds to be asleep to get your 8 to 9 hours of sleep a day because the consequences are not good. The worse thing you ever did was change that routine. I can not stress that enough. Change is the worse thing ever. If you decide to be a bad *** and have a week long beer festival, book yourself a room at the ER, cuz it's coming. You mind can no longer handle drastic changes. No matter what they tell you, once you break your routine you are screwed. You are not God. But you do not need to be a doctor to listen to your body. I'll be thirty this year... Im going on my first cruise ever in 2 months... honestly I'm scared **** less, I have never been outside of my time zone, outside of my ""coastal area""  I've been through every single medication, you could name, and they'd work great! 6 months later... there's a thing called immunity, you go to sleep one night and you and your doctor are not on that same 6 month schedule... you're screwed you are never ever ever going to be on that dosage of that medicine for the rest of your life. The moral of the story is withdrawal.  Whether it be alcohol, weed, sleep, drugs, pills, your *** was doing it, you second guessed it decided enough was enough, and you woke up the next day doing some of the weirdest things you've ever even heard of. And if you're still having them you can't control your habits, you go out and splurge, and it comes back and bites you in the ***, because why does it have to be you, right? Whether it had been peer pressure, child abuse, neglect, bullying, whatever the reason had been, we still made the decision to do what we did, and messed up as this sounds, until you sit there and ask yourself how am I going to do this right... it really is never going to get any better, because there is absolutely no medication out there that is going to let you go out and party like a rock star 3 to 4 days a week and hide it the other half. So if you want to drink... drink but don't go deciding 2 months down the road because you're wife doesn't like sleeping next to that smell anymore that ur just going to quit cold turkey, because now your *** is going to withdrawl. You think your body can handle Marijuana and it helps you like it does millions and millions of other people, then smoke it. Just don't go deciding because u have a panic attack on night watching some horror movie that you're going to quit smoking weed all of a sudden, cuz you know what... yea you're vulnerable to it now, there's a 75% chance it's coming. Don't be afraid to ask for help. You can go from drinking 4 cups of coffee and day to thinking I don't want this **** no more.. and guess what... Yeah. That 8-9 hours of sleep cut down to 5-6, in just 2 days. Yeah I tried being a bad *** once but get this... In 48 hours changing your sleep pattern by 2 hours messes with sooo many things 1 your amount of sleep, but the amount of energy you use, the time you take your medication, the amount of time your medication is actively working, it is crazy, your medicine doesn't work right if it is not actively working. But not only that.. you're going to drink more coffee, drink more beer, smoke more weed, use more energy, then there it is. There is just soo many things you have to take into consideration now that you are part of the epileptic world, and it really as much as you want to brush it off, it is not a joke. Get on a schedule, keep it, decide is this the life I'm going to live because once I'm ready for a change, as much as it *****, you pretty much need to be locked down in a facility for your own safety. Be honest not only with each other but be honest with yourself","answer"

I got the diagnosis from a neurologist after I had done an EEG. He tried to prescribe valporat to me, which I refused to take, because my mother also suffers from epilepsy (only while sleeping) since the age of 14 and no medication stopped her having seizures. Many of these antiepileptic drugs also have bad side effects, which I did not want to suffer from. I got an MRI scan of my brian, but the neurologist who diagnosed me did not see any abnormality. Half a year ago I made an appointment at a hospital nearby which is known for its competence when it comes to epilepsy.The doctor I visited immediately saw an abnormality on my temporal lobe (especially the hippocampus and parts of the amygdala..I think the left one) and I made an appointment for staying a week at the hospital to get further medical investigation. After I had done a second MRI scan, the doctors came to the conclusion that my temporal lobe was inflamed and recommended a cortisone therapy...although I told them that I smoked cannabis on a daily basis for a long time, they never made a statement that this could have caused my seizures...but after I did some investigation myself, I am pretty sure now that this caused my epilepsy, since cannabinoids have an immune-suppressive effect and my increasing tolerance for thc/cbd could have ****** up my immune system to cause it to attack my own braincells. Also cannabinoids are known to affect the hippocampus & amygdala. I stopped smoking about 4 months ago, at first it had no effect on my monthly occurring seizures but now I didn't have a seizure for about 2 months. I'm still not 100% sure if the cortisone is effective or its caused by not smoking weed anymore...although I still love weed, but I think it's not worth the risk. If someone of you wants to get an update, let me know.P.S My seizures always start with a very strong déjà vu aura and often culminate into a grand mal, but not always. Sometimes I only get multiple auras throughout the day.Sorry for possible mistakes, I come from germany, so I'm not a native speaker.","answer"

I still can't say if the cortisone-therapy had an effect or not-smoking weed caused this, but I also started smoking weed again a couple of months ago and it didn't change anything... If it was caused by an inflammation it could have left some scarred tissue on my hippocampus/amygdala which is still causing my seizures.I stopped smoking weed and cigarettes again a month ago and this time I will also try to stop smoking cigarettes in the long term (forever).I think first of all (at least for myself) a healthy amount of sleep is very important.I think first of all I have a genetic predisposition which I got from my mother. Anyway, the outbreak of epilepsy in the late 20s isn't uncommon (pubery also is a common time for an outbreak of epilepsy)...it is assumed to be connected to a change in the hormone balance, at least if you already have a disposition for it.But I also think in my case a possible cause may be that smoking weed changes your sleep phases in a way that the REM phases are shortened.When you go to sleep while stoned as a daily smoker you will dream less and shorter!Although it's still unclear what exactly is the purpose of dreaming, I think it is strongly linked to the process of memory-forming and the hippocampus also plays a big role in this task....so maybe there is a link!So I would still recommend every weed smoker who has an abnormality in his temporal lobe (especially hippocampus) to stop smoking as soon as possible, just to be sure!I will try to give an update in a couple of months if anyone is interested.","answer"

As I wrote above, I get very strong déjà-vus which often culminate in a grand mal.All I can suggest is to stop smoking and try to find other methods for relaxation / stress relieving, like autogenous training, meditation etc. I know it is hard to accept, I miss smoking MJ too but unless you can't exclude it as a trigger you have to try! Besides, you already seem to know that there might be a link to heavy smoking triggering your seizures!My last episode was 2 1/2 weeks ago and it was the first time in AGES that the occuring auras did not culminate in a grand-mal, so I have to consider to never smoke again :(.

I ended up having a small seizure and waking up in college, taken to hospital for a check up. After an MRI scan (a few days later I think) I was told a small tumor had developed. This lead to becoming epileptic. I had most of it removed in 2011, but since early 00s to now have been on medication. Its not a high dosage compared to some other people with major epilepsy, 3 tablets twice a day (1xtegretol 400mg,1xsodium valproate 500mg, 1xkeppra 500mg). It took until 2006 to actually find the right dosage of meds to stop the seizures completely.The gp and specialists I saw stated that cannabis was known to have both pro convulsive and anti convulsive properties after lighting up, and it was highly likely that it was the cause of my epilepsy. It would seem that it can play a large part in playing with your long term mental stability, but they said they were seeing an increase in the number of cases such as mine over the last few years possibly linked to cannabis usage. I am ok now but on a couple of occasions I have forgetten to take meds which can lead to a little anxiety (happened on one occasion, eg 7 hours too late-suddenly getting a bit shaky lol). I think the side effects of the meds may also lead to a problem with my sleeping pattern. Either that or its just me staying on this computer for too long. A bit of both I suppose :) The only other side issue with epilepsy is to do with either blood flow or nerves in which some people you can feel an odd tic (tingling or pin like nerve stabbing sensation followed by hot feeling). I have found online this is common with some people with epilepsy.I no longer smoke anything as that would definitely make me worse, but its a definite to me that the smoking caused my problem. Some people can smoke heavily and show few problems all their lives, but even then I would still question their mental status judging by certain people I have met in the past. Upon searching on here to find this discussion (and on some of the pro cannabis and student websites) it is obvious that marijuana is a common trigger for seizures, although its not something many pro smokers want to hear.

I had/have been a heavy user of cannabis for about 16 years. This started with low grade soap bar until I was able to source skunk and harder varieties.

So indicate or sativa, whatever was on offer without a lot of choice. I never really drank and have only ever dabbled with hard drugs and not had anything like that for about 10 years ( I'm 34 now).About 18 months ago I started to have complex partial seizures and was diagnosed with idiopathic epilepsy after video evidence of my seizure was shown to doctors.I've been on lamictal for 12 months and had no seizures since then.I absolutely loved smoking green and convinced myself that I had always been on the spectrum for epilepsy, therefore self medicating that whole time, in a bid to justify my continued use.I've been smoking heavily since taking lamictal and have had no seizures. However, I've quit smoking for relationship and motivational reasons.I've had to come to the realisation that long term pot use, rather than suppressing seizures, may have been a contributing factor to my onset of epilepsy.Hard to takeAs I say I loved weed and believe most drugs should be legalised ( war on drugs is terrible destructive).

Although around august after a 1 1/2 years after my first seizure i drank to excess two nights in a row... as well as had sleep deprivation those two nights (3-4hrs). and so the following morning after the second night of excess drinking and not much sleep i had my second grand-mal in which ohhhh now im diagnosed with epilepsy and need to take keppra 2x a day 500mg(morning & night). Even though i was diagnosed i thought it was just another freak accident and it was just provoked by terrible sleep as well as drinking more than anyone ever should.. so since august i quit smoking marijuana/drinking and I started taking keppra and was inconsistent with taking the medicine which what do you know.... CAUSES seizures... and then had my third one. so i began taking the medicine consistently and then came the day after christmas... i missed one dose before bed on christmas day and because i did.. boom another seizure.. so now ive had 4.. 2 of them happening after being on the medicine keppra and completely quit smoking/drinking.. and they've happened back to back months... so yeah im beginning to think marijuana definitely helps with controlling seizures... at least of course for me because i smoked about every day after a couple months of scare after my first one and i went a year and a half seizure free.. until of course the nights of intense drinking & sleep deprivation. currently i still have not smoked since my 2nd one back in august although if i have another while being consistent on meds i will feel as if though i must because in my opinion it has controlled my seizures before i even knew I was susceptible to even having them.

I suffered from epilepsy for 5 years then i had a right frontal craniotomy which took my seizures away, i had never been happier. About a year and a half went by, i had moved back to my home country, and my mum was pressuring me to go out and drink with her, my mum had a very strong hold on me. Anyway, i was drinking alcohol, i wasnt taking my meds properly and i was severly stressed out by her. I ended up having a seizure and now its been nearly 3 years and ive had another 2. I am depressed, constantly stressed and my anxiety is through the roof which is the LAST thing i need! Recently i have had multiple people tell me they think if i started using cannabis (not by smoking) it could really help1 me.

Starting around two years ago, I noticed that alcohol doesn't get me drunk, or even tipsy -- it just gives me body aches, headaches and fatigue.  There's no lowered inhibitions or warm, fuzzy sense of well-being or any of the other things people want from drinking.  No matter how small or large the amount.  At first I thought this a side effect of the anticonvulsant I take (Keppra) -- the instructions say to avoid alcohol because very serious interactions can occur, although they never specify what those interactions are.   A couple medical professionals I talked to about it said that it's because Keppra increases the level of enzymes present in my liver, thereby speeding up my liver's metabolic rate.  So my body just skips the drunkenness stage altogether.   But a month and a half ago I started seeing a new neurologist, who said that this is neither a Keppra thing nor an epilepsy thing, and in fact, he has no idea what it's about.  And that Keppra is processed through the kidneys, not the liver.  So I'm back to the drawing board. And two neurologists now have told me it's okay to drink, provided that I never get drunk (because that does lower your seizure threshold).  And as previously stated, alcohol doesn't get me drunk anymore anyway.   My current neurologist said that I if I do drink, I need to precede and follow every alcoholic drink with a non-alcoholic one.  Drinking water and alcohol in a 2:1 ratio was already standard next-day hangover prevention procedure for me when I started noticing these symptoms, and yeah -- it hasn't been enough at all.  It takes more like a whole day's worth of water for me to not be in pain from one alcoholic drink.","question"

Apparently, taking calcium at the same time as dilantin can prevent the dilantin from getting absorbed into your blood. After being seizure free for almost 25 years, I had two seizures, and, of course, was completely devistated. None of the doctors or pharmacists knew why, and like you Chris, I'm sure they thought that after 35 years I must have started to just forget.

He has been on Dilantin for 12 years. He takes 500mg/day but his level is 5, which is the highest it has been in 6 months. I am trying to allow him to handle things hiimself since he is 22 but I made a call to his neuro last Friday, however, I haven't received a call back. I opted to write him a letter and faxed it to him today. I have researched and spoken with my doctor about it and was told that after taking Dilantin for so long the liver, for the lack of a better way of describing it, builds up a tolerance to the medication and hypermetabolize it. This causes a low level but is often blamed on non-compliance. I guess the solution is to change the medication regimen to something easier on the liver. The problem with that is there are few anticonvulsants that are easy on the liver and you have to be weaned off the Dilantin due to dependency. I am worried about my son's safety and pray for him continuously. He is eight hours away and I feel very lost. Good luck to you Cala.","answer"

I am currently 22 years old, and this started when I was about 10 or 11. My dad asked me to grab him scissors for this thing he was working on, and on my way back to him I lost my sight like tunnel vision, the sounds around me got muddled and I dropped to the ground started to shake violently for about 3-4 seconds. My dad yelled at me to get over to him, he thought I was joking around, I tried to tell him I wasn't, but he didn't believe me, so I kept all my incidences to myself from that moment on. Everyone I've told about this just told me I got up to fast and it happens to everyone. It wasn't until I watched this show that told me when you get seizures you lose vision and sound goes away for a while. Ever since that day something of the same sorts have been happening at least 15-30 times a year, randomly spaced within the year. This year and last they have been happening more frequently. within this week I experienced this about 4 times. Let me describe what I usually feel: there is a dull pain in my frontal lobe. I lose my vision first, it just sort of fades until I can't see anything, then my body goes ridged, sometimes I'll just drop or sometimes I'll have enough control over my body to put down whatever I'm holding and grab onto something or fall over nicely on a couch or bed. My heart is racing and there is a little bit of pressure on my temples and pain around my eyes as if I'm straining to see. Then I begin to shake sometimes violently sometimes only a little. And sometimes I'm still able to stand, but my legs and arms twitch. I wait until my vision comes back and my limbs stop moving, then I take deep breathes to calm my heart and slowly get up and I continue on my day feeling fine, but there is sometimes that I hear a ringing in my ears for a little while after the episodes happen. These usually last about 5-15 seconds. Sometimes I can repress it, like I feel it's about to happen and I focus on my breathing, my vision blurs a little, then it goes away. I don't know if that's what I'm really doing, but it feels like I am.  Apart of me has always suspected it was some kind of seizure, but I never wanted to really know, not until the circumstances in my life makes me want to know that I am okay, that I still have years to enjoy life. (sorry for the depression)​I know I should see a doctor, but I just want to ask forums if they have any other advice other than seeing a doctor or if they know more about what I could possibly have.","question"

It sounds like your boyfriend had a Grand Mal or Tonic-Clonic seizure when that happens the best thing you can do for someone in that position is just minimize safety hazards (chairs, tables, etc) and roll him on his side to keep his airway (mouth and nose) clear if the seizure persists for (and I may be wrong here) 10-15 minutes call 9-1-1. They could be experiencing status epilepticus at that point and develop hypoxia (lack of oxygen start showing cyanosis which is bluish gray discoloration around the lips) when people have seizures like the one you described they do not/cannot breathe. I'm not a doctor I am just speaking from personal experience.  A little sidenote do not put things such as a spoon or stick in his mouth while this is happening that is dated information and could ruin his teeth if he were to bite down. Seizure victims have never bitten their tongue off if anything you would probably need to be worried about the tongue actually blocking off the airway. Also he could've been experiencing a dystonic reaction which mimics a seizure. I see this post was from 2010 and I'm sure you may already know what I have written down. Also I have never seen the movie ""Crazies"" however if there were some scenes where there were flashing lights or random colors that could trigger a seizure and head trauma could cause seizures as well. I hope this helps and I hope I wasn't simply repeating information that you have may have since researched for your boyfriend's well-being.","answer"

I have anxiety, that just makes my stomach feel upset at different times throughout the day. However, I am a very driven and active person, I work, I am in the second year of attaining my Bachelor's degree and Teaching Certificate. I have also been seeing a therapist once a week for the last year, working through the things from my childhood; and although I feel I have worked through a lot of problems I still feel sick from anxiety and random adrenaline bursts. That being said:In the last 4-5 months I have had some strange...let's call them ""episodes."" The first experience I had was at my house on a normal calm day. I was standing in my office listing to my boyfriend talk to me from the kitchen. All of the sudden, it was like everything was hyper focused, and I could swear that I had heard/seen what he was saying before. My body became stiff and I couldn't make my self move. It was like Deja Vu, but nothing I have ever experienced before. Then my body started getting cold and hot sweats (like when you have the flu) it lasted a few more seconds (I think) and then I instantly threw up afterwards. I tried not to throw up, but it was just like having the flu, I realized that it was going to happen, and I ran for the trash can. After all of this, my boyfriend said that he kept trying to talk to me, but I wouldn't respond (or when i did he said I just sort of mumbled and it didn't make sense.) (Each of my ""episodes"" have lasted 40 seconds to 2min)After this first episode, I just returned to normal life, however it happened three more times over the next 3-4 months. At this point I was getting a little concerned, and the episodes, are unlike anything I have experienced, they are scary. So I searched for Deja Vu and throwing up, and Temporal Lobe Epilepsy was the first thing to pop up. Reading the symptom description resonated a lot with me, but I didn't want to bring it up to my therapist, because I figured it was just coincidence, or that I was finding myself a Scapegoat. However, yesterday I had another episode. It was right after I woke up and my boyfriend was talking to me, I remember that he showed me a picture of the U.S. with different colors on the states; and I knew the colors were supposed to represent some sort of demographic. However, it felt like Deja Vu, it felt like it had definitely happened before, I could hear him talking, but it was like the voices form the Deja vu feeling made his words just not make sense to me, and my body did the cold-hot sweats, but it was a lot worse than the other times. I had my palms pressed against my legs, trying to feel the pressure, and not pay attention to everything else that was going on in my body. It didn't work though, and as soon as it was over, I jumped out of bed and threw up nothing but bile, (the same as every other episode.) This episode was the worst one so I decided to talk to my therapist, I told her everything that I had experienced, and asked if she thought it could be MTLE, and she said that I didn't have that and diagnosed me with Depersonalizaltion/Derealization Disorder. I accepted what she said, I was upset, but I was ready to work through it. Not knowing about Depersonalizaltion Disorder, I started doing research, and reading blogs and experiences other people have with Depersonalization Disorder. According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness, ""This disorder involves ongoing feelings of detachment from actions, feelings, thoughts and sensations as if they are watching a movie (depersonalization). Sometimes other people and things may feel like people and things in the world around them are unreal (derealization)""....""The average onset age is 16, although depersonalization episodes can start anywhere from early to mid childhood. Less than 20% of people with this disorder start experiencing episodes after the age of 20.""I am 24 years old, It would be pretty rare for me to be experiencing Depersonalization for the first time at my age, not to mention that the symptoms do not line up with what has happened to me. She said that I didn't need to do an MRI or anything, to rule out physical causes. She said that she knew that it was Depersonalization. I would appreciated any advice, from what I have read Depersonalizaiton is just as big of a deal as MTLE is, I just feel like I should make sure that there are no physical causes. To rule it out and make sure that I am treated for the right thing. If you don't think it is MTLE or Depersonalization, I would appreciate any guidance as to what else might be causing my symptoms or ""episodes.""","question"

She has what I call seizure like episodes. Every episode starts off with a headache, flushing, nausea, dizziness, dilated pupils (non reactive) with a blank stare, convulsions and passing out. We have seen 2 neurologist and they seem to think it is pseudo seizures due to the EEG being normal and the fact that she does not loose bodily fuctions.. but I disagree. My daughter has no anxiety in her life and is not stressed out. We have seen a cardiologist and found out that she has mitral valve prolapse which is mild. During her episodes she has been either tachycardia, bradycardia or normal it varies. During one episode the EMT did a sternum rub on her and she did not react at all. All test have come back normal...EEG, EKG (after episode), MRI, CT, Tilt test and blood work. It has been very scary for both of us. We can't seem to get any answers from anyone except she is ""faking them"" which is not true if the Dr could see her have an episode then they would think differently. The EMT's and fire dept staff have seen her have an episode and they believe something is going on also. My daughter has been diagnosed with Migraine and placed on Topamax which they say can help with the seizure like activity. We have been to the ER multiple times due to these episodes and even spent 3 days in the hospital and was discharged with a diagnosis of convulsions, migraines and conversion disorder. Each episode has been a little different in nature but they all have the same starting symptom of a headache, dizziness, nausea, dilated pupils, flushing and blurred vision. We are suppose to go see another neurologist in a few weeks and having a 24 hr EEG done. Any help will be greatly appreciated.","question"

First a quick back story..I am a disabled Veteran. Due to my service connected shoulder injury I have had 7 operations. In the time I had the operations over the course of 4 years I was on OxyContin for three and a half years of it. Finally the shoulder felt better but the pain meds were quite hard to stop on my own so I went to rapid detox doctor in Manhattan that had me on a ton of things. I cut those down as well and since I suddenly stopped the Lorazopan but still took Wellbutrin I suffered a grand mal seizure in the doctors office. I don't remember a month before the seizure or a week after and the next week is fuzzy. Since then I had a small issue with short term memory but over the last 6 months or so it has gotten worse. The seizure was about ten years ago and I'm now 37 years old. No drugs, I don't drink or smoke, a great job helping combat veterans readjust to civilian life for the government (VA), and a BS in Finance. But, this short term memory loss worries me. It just about leveled off and is consistent. I can't remember what I was doing a couple minutes ago if it was a small thing. I do remember big things though. It's just short term memory and sometimes I'll be talking and if distracted, when I go back to conversation I can't remember what I was talking about. My question is, could a single seizure that severe be the cause of this? I'm going to see the VA doc soon about it and since they connected the seizure to my disability being related to the surgeries, I'm wondering if the memory loss could be connected as well. I'm looking for a straight answer, mainly so I know what to do about it and it worries me. The extra couple dollars in my check isn't the issue as I make plenty. Please let me know so I know my next step. I do appreciate it. BrianP.s. I do not suffer from PTSD or any other trauma related illness, no depression or anxiety and no family history of Alzheimer's or epilepsy.","question"

And I really wonder if a scientist who have founded a link between two of them could freely confess it. I mean I know that medical sector is like mafia sector unfortunately. There is big money going on there.Well here is my story.My wife had been Lasik when she was 18. Now she is 29 and she had her first photoepileptic seisure while on pc monitor watching matrix 3(she was on menses period). We didn't want to take medicine yet. Cause they say everyone has a seisure chanse for once. But 39 days later, one day after on our 6th anniversary she had her second seisure.(we had drunk two 70cl bottles of wine (one for each) on anniversary. She was just logging in to facebook with 10inch tablet pc this time. Already everything in this era is about technology, monitors, screens. And even we are both web designers. So it's really bad for us. So she started to use medicine(lamictal) 3 days ago.I'm really worried for her. she has heavy pains for 3-4 days on her shoulders and arms after seisures. Even she felt down from bed on that second seisure and so on her back.I can't really believe that science haven't solved this ill. They almost got no real idea.Well about her first seisure again. Monitor was 22'' Samsung 60hz. It was my monitor, but I gave her about a month ago or so before her seisure. She was using 19'' Samsung 60hz before that. But I had used that 22'' Samsung for almost 12 years. And I spent my life on computers like no one else could. I mean almost 12 hours a day and for almost 14-15 years. She started to use like me ( 8-10hours a day) after marriage(6 years).I searched for monitor hz. How it was linked with seisures. And I saw, someone's post. He had got her first seisure 6,5 months after he had bought 120hz monitor. So I think using 120hz monitor is not a solution.I really wonder what is behind this. Lasik ? Brain ? Monitor ? Morpheus ? lol I really want to solve this.","answer"

Could any of the above be linked? all due to one origin as opposed to 3 separate conditions that I have? I have read somewhere that face blindness is prevalent is AS/Autism - but is there a common neurological/origin? As for Temporal Lobe Epilepsy - TLE is can be caused by a problem/defect/trauma in the Temporal lobe - interesting though Prosopagnosia is also commonly caused by damage/defects in the temporal lobe - this would indicate a possible link but I have failed to find any papers/articles about the two (together) via google. I mentioned the Prosopagnosia to my Neurologist - never asked whether there is a link though - I won't se e him again until after my tests (EEG, MRI) which will be in a month or two (the NHS (UK health provider) - whilst free - is so slow) Anyone else have Prosopagnosia, TLE aswell as AS/Autism? all thoughts welcome","question"

I have been on keppra or the off brand of keppra for 2 months after stopping Dilantin, and I'm scared to start driving, is there any way to put this out of mind? I'm scared if I start driving I'll have an episode while driving and I really don't want to hurt anyone or myself. If anyone has any suggestions or went through what I'm going through that would be great.  I really do miss being able to go out on my own accord, but the thought of having a seizure while driving scares the living crap out of me, as if having one wasn't scary enough lol. Thank you for reading this, and have a nice day. ~ Kyle","question"

The fear will get less over time but it will never go away completely. I think about it every time I get behind the wheel and I have been having seizures since 99. It is not me that I worry about it is the other people on the road. If I have a seizure and hurt or god forbid kill someone I would not be able to live with myself.I don't know what the rules are for driving in your state, but when I lived in Ohio I had to be seizure free for six months before I was able to get behing the wheel. So make sure you know the laws and just be careful. Start off with short distances and go from there.","answer"

So they just said well you just must have seizures some times and offered no more information/solutions.He hasn't had any seizures like that for a bit over a year.  However, last night we experienced the most terrifying episode of what we aren't sure.  In the middle of the night he bolted up, started screaming and kicking/punching/flailing.  I didn't know what to do/what was going on and thought it was just a horrible night mare or something  so I started saying (and then shouting) his name and trying to hold him but he was unresponsive and kept the screaming and flailing going for about 2 minutes.  When he finally came out of it he said he was screaming becuase I was screaming and he felt like some one was in the room and about to attack him.  It was the most scared I've ever seen him, and he said he'd never been so terrified in his life.Was this episode perhaps of really extreme sleep paralysis? Or could it be a sign of some type of seizure?  Or something else entirely? He also twitches very hard in his sleep - if that bit of information means anything.Any advice would be so greatly appreciated.","question"

In some cases, individuals are likely to have even more elaborate motor activity, such as a thrashing of limbs—which may include punching, swinging, or fleeing motions.

We went to A&E we stayed 2 weeks However all tests came back showing nothing brain Scan MRI and EEG All normal, Sometimes head turns to left too when it's strong. His seizures Always to left.Eye rolling moving to left continued but we were able to control them without medication, We were doing a mixture of Chinese medicine & acupuncture and homeopathy. His seizures was every week or two week, In October We were told to start keppra medication but he was really improving and we didn't want to start Keppra because of the side effects, However after having a 3 week free spell (we thought we were out of it) on New Years 2015 he had seizures on and off all day. This had never happened before, this continued for two days resulting in his left arm and leg not moving. We call doctor he told us go A&E about his left arm and leg sided weakness, we went to A&E they told us to stay in case he has stroke or bleeding in back of his brain we did brain Scan that Night it came back normal nothing (Thank God for that) We were in hospital for 1 week his Consultant Want him to do MRI,MRA, EEG, Lumbar puncture while they did all tests again. They started his keppra. Thank god after a few days he started moving his left arm and leg again. The tests all came back normal  Lumbar puncture showing nothing again, so they said they don't think it's epilepsy. For three weeks he improved on the keppra not one seizure, he started crawling for the first time and again we thought this thing was over. Then suddenly his arm stopped, he had a mild seizure with it. Since then his arm and leg keep paralysing and he is having siezures with it to. It's become so regular now, almost everyday and for long periods. He is spacey and stiff through his whole body when it happens. It's so hard to see. When he plays happily and he is ok he really improves and is such a happy boy, but this is starting to get more regular and it's really distressing for him, he seems very uncomfortable and upset when it happens. We don't know what to do, his Consultant say put keppra dose up we did still not improving,and the neurologists still can't tell us what this, were waiting for genetics blood test, He's quite delayed on a lot of things but he is crawling and holding and standing when he's ok. his 14 months, We don't know what to do anymore.

I've had seizures ever since puberty and what you are describing sounds a lot like a seizure. You're doctor may be heading somewhere saying    it's correlated with stress. Stress is the number one main trigger for a seizure to occur. I haven't had one for a few years but I frequently had them during my period when I was more stressed. I would also have them before an event I was anxious about such as a test or a race or when exposed to strobe lights which also cause stress and even whenever I had a fever. If they are seizures, you sound pretty alert though during them which sometimes I was pretty alert despite my lack of control and sometimes I wasn't. I'm no neurologist, but speaking from my own experience. These things don't make someone mental at all like what some people think but it's still a problem for people. But I wish you luck and I hope it's not seizures.","answer"

First I would like to start off by saying that it is possible carbamazepine was no longer effective because his body started to became to immune to it.I know you do not want to hear this but finding the correct type of seizure medication or even medication's that will control his seizures could be a long and frustrating process. I have been there.Keppra did not work for me, I was maxed out on it and I was still having seizures almost daily. Right now I am on 4 different types of seizure medications and I also have a VNS device implanted in my chest. I am still have seizures and my neurologist says that I might never be seizure free. That is just something that I have to live with. I do not like it but there is nothing that I can do about it. You can either cry or laugh about it.One of my drugs happens to be Lamotrigene (600mg per day). My suggestion is to give the medication some time to take effect. Also keep in mind that there is no way that his doctor can predict what drug will be the ""magic"" one. So please just keep that in mind.","answer"

It tends to be the highest in amplitude and the slowest waves. It is seen normally in adults in slow wave sleep. It is also seen normally in babies. It may occur focally with subcortical lesions and in general distribution with diffuse lesions, metabolic encephalopathy hydrocephalus or deep midline lesions.What it basically indicates is that its presence in your EEG when you are not asleep is pathological i.e. indicative of the possible area in your brain which is triggering your epileptic seizures.ref:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography","answer"

Work benefits? Does your state offer any assistance. I live in Ma and its mandatory to have health insurance, you get fined if you don't and employers must offer it. The state helps to get you health insurance with consideration of your income. If I were you I'd be concerned. You almost had a seizure in the shower! What if you hit or head on the tub or when you were trying to get out? I woke up in the middle of the night, went in the bathroom, and when I fainted I hit my head on the sink, then the bath, then the floor. As you can tell, I have a small bathroom. I could feel bruises around my head but it was so numb they didn't hurt until the next day. I'm not so sure about the blurry vision, so I'm not much help there. Also, I don't know why all the tests were negative if you had a seizure. I developed epilepsy during puberty when my body chemistry changed. Do you think it could be a pre-menopause kind of thing? (I'm only 19 so I don't exactly know when that stuff starts).I also think that seizures can be brought on by other things like hypoglycemia or diabetes, something like that. I know for sure that diabetes can cause vision difficulties. Maybe there's some kind of correlation, just a thought.No advice can replace that of a doctor. I've seen doctors on this website post answers to questions. Try some research from all kinds of web sites and write down questions/symptoms so that when you do go to the doctors you can make the best out of the visit. If you know you'll need more than the usual 15 min appointment, tell the receptionist so you can get more time. Especially since you can't afford to keep going to the doctors without health insurance. Best of Luck.","answer"

If you do not achieve satisfactory seizure control with keppra, or are not happy down the road with this doc, shoot for an epileptologist (an ""epi"").  It helps to be patient, but shoot for seizure control as soon as you can, not simply seizure reduction.  (By the way, do your complex partial seizures come the right or left side, and are they from the temporal lobe?)  Remember, the earlier the better in terms of long term seizure control.  Refractory complex partial seizures, which very often occur in the temporal lobe, can become harder and harder to control, usually worsening with time, and can lead to scarring of the hippocampus (where seizures most often originate from) and furstrating permanent memory probs/memory loss, which I can relate to from years of personal experience.  People who have difficult cases of epilepsy are often referred by neurologists to epis, but some docs have a hard time addmitting their knowledge is limited.  My experiences over the years involved both.  I was at an Epilepsy Foundation meeting in Chicago a few years ago, attended, of course, by both neuros and epis.  When asked multiple quiz questions about epilepsy, it was shocking how poorly many neuros actually did, only answering correctly about 50% of the questions.  Many neuros are not also familiar with the newest  anticonvulsants on the market.  Keppra has been around for a while, not old, but not new either.  Epis are much more in tune with newer meds.  Currently, there were at least 3 or 4 new meds out in the last year.  Despite the fact that epilepsy is one of the most common neurological conditions, many neuros do not know as much as they should--they know more about MS or parkinson's.  Some of the neuros I saw, before I went to an epi, were absurdly ignorant.  But, of course, there are some good neurologists out there as well.  Those who are best will send you to an epi if they feel it is necessary.  Mixing seizure meds, knowing which ones to use (keeping in mind there are over 40 types of seizures--epilepsy is being referred to by some as a spectrum disorder), epis tend to better know the ins and outs, and various types of cocktails known to help with different types of seizures.  It's an art.  So, good luck to you, and keep me posted.  Send me an e-mail if you choose, whatever.  Sometimes going to a teaching hospital is good--neuros and epis work in groups, along with other docs, and make suggestions/observations.  On a final note, if you happen to know of a good pain clinic which helps people with chronic pain, especially resulting from brain surgery/craniotomy, pls. let me know.  That is one of the impacts of my brain surgery I am desperately trying to resolve--the pain has been hell.  Take care, and wish you all the best!!!  Cheers--","answer"

epileptologist.  They know much more than the average neurologist.  Great you have all these questions.  Since you're new to the epilepsy community, and are learning about epilepsy/seizures, it's good to do as much research as you can, and familiarize yourself with different types of seizures.  It's amazing how many different types of seizures there are, affecting b/tw 2.5 to 3 million Americans, although estimates tend to lean toward the latter  There are over 40 types of szs, sorted basically into ""partial"" (simple and complex partial) and ""generalized"" seizures (primary and secondary).  The very basics: Simple partial seizures are also known as auras, and are primarily subjective (people around you don't usually know you're experiencing a seizure) where you have an awkward inner sensation, like being pulled out of your body, floating above yourself (temporal lobe), so to say, or see flashing lights (occipital lobe), or have uncontrolled motor response, such as a shaking of the arm, for example (motor cortex, b/tw the frontal and parietal lobe).  All depends on where in the brain it occurs.  If you have complex partial seizures, the aura is like your ""warning,"" varying in length from a split second to 30 or more seconds.  Complex partial is where the seizure activity spreads, involving enough of the brain to alter your state of consciousness/awareness, usually anywhere from 30 seconds to 2 minutes (follows you aura).  You come to afterwards feeling tired and confused, and it takes a while to even realize you've had a seizure.  Sometimes seizure activity can spread,involving the entire brain, often leading to the ""classic"" seizure, or convulsion, i.e. tonic-clonic seizure, lasting anywhere from 2 to five min. or more.  Called secondary generalized seizures.  Partial seizures can be caused by scaring from an accident, a tumor, or for many reasons we don't yet understand.  Primary generalized seizrues, of which there many kinds, not simply the classic tonic-clonic, involve the entire brain from the onset.  In general, primary generalized seizures are easier to control with meds, but every case is different.  (The type of med you get depends on the type of seizures you have) People with primary gen. seizures often do not have auras.  These are simply the basic rules.  If you can, it's good to check out a recent book or two from the library, and read up.  Make sure it's very, very recent.  There has been so much research/better understanding of epilepsy simply over the past 10 years.  (Plus, MRIs are SO much better now as compared to 10-15 years ago.  Try to get at least a 3 Tesla.  If there is an abnormality on your MRI, take it to another doc, and see if they get the same reading.  My brain tumor, the initial reason I started having epilepsy, was misdiagnosed for years, unfortunately)  Regarding recent info, which I was discussing above, before my little ""note"" on MRIs, you can go on the epilepsy foundation website.  I know the Epilepsy Foundation operates in every state....if you need any help with anything, finding a good doc, or even for help getting around (i.e. the driving issue) or help paying for meds, contact the foundation.  They can be very helpful, as many seizure meds are very expensive, unfortunately.  It seems like the more necessary the medication, the more expensive it tends to be.  REdiculous, really.  But often times the doc has many samples of meds.....my epileptologist's nurse pracitioner gives me tons of samples, which helps.  My Lamictal XR, for example, costs, per month, b/tw $1,750 and $1,925.  Thank god for the help I get paying for drugs, but it is absurd.   Also, don't let anyone try to talk you into generics.  It is generally known that generics simply are not as effective regarding seizure meds brand names.  Multiple studies have shown this.  The active component may be the same, but the ""inactive"" ingredients--and there are many--will affect the effectiveness of the active ingredient, how well it is absorbed, for example, although drug companies will deny it.  Generics are not tested the way brand names are.  In any case, some of the newer meds are patented, and do not yet have generics, but if you can, avoid them.  Before I forget.....make sure you ask your doc about such things as vitamin deficiencies caused by many different meds.  Vitamin D is often depleted, and calcium or magnesium can also be affected.  Make sure you get regular blood workups, especially regarding how much of the medication you take actually gets absorbed into your system.Oh, to answer your question, usually you have to be 6 months completely seizure free, unfortunately, but many people ""tweek"" the edges of the 6 month rule, and I can understand.  From over 16 years of experience with seizures, I can tell you that you are less prone to having a seizure when you are concentrating on what you are doing, actually.  I've never driven a car, but have driven a tractor since I was 12 years old (have 7 acres of land), never having a seizure while driving.  It's usually when you're tired, during sleep, or when you're relaxing after a hard day's work/lots of stress that you have a seizure.  Kind of when your guard is down, although if you have refractory epilepsy, or occaisional breakout seizures, it is frustrating.  I often have had seizures while asleep, or while I play piano, actually.  When ""relaxing"" so to say, but one can never predict 100%.  Many women are more likely to have seizures just before (like two days or so) or during their menstrual cycles.  Some have seizures close to when they ovulate, i.e. day 15 or so.  Some women have catamenial epilepsy, or epilepsy which is directly related to hormones, and thus take birth control pills to help regulate their period, or stop it all together.  Every case is so different.....many cases are not affected by hormones alone.Whatever happens, don't let anyone on the job discriminate/fire you simply because of your epilepsy.  You should not feel ashamed or embarrased.  If you feel you have been discriminated against because of your epilepsy, talk to the epilepsy foundation in your area.  Many lawsuits have been filed regarding this due to, unfortunately, to public ignorance, fear, and discrimination.  And then there is always the ADA, (Americans with Disabilites Act)restored to its full capacity, so to  say, last year.  Don't let anyone BS you around.  THere unfortunately is still a lot of discrimination regarding seizures...epilepsy is known as the ""neglected stepchild of neurological diseases,"" actually.  Third most common neurological disease, behind stroke and alzheimer's.   If you have questions, a great organization to contact is Susan Axelrod's foundation called CURE, or Citizens United for Research in Epilepsy.  The Axelrod's daughter, now 29, I think, has had a severe case of epilepsy for much of her life.  Luckily, her seizures have been controlled for 9 years now.  She's on Keppra, actually!Just so you know, I sent you an e-mail.  Sometimes

Hopefully someone can help!Basically I'm suffering from Seizures and they're becoming more frequent. I am on 1,000mg of Keppra twice a day 12 hours apart (Morning & Night)I have lost count of how many I have had but my first one was around 4 years ago now and was believed to be cause by severe dehydration working physically in 40-45+c Degree heat with not enough fluids to drink. -I was taken to hospital and put on a drip when I quickly felt better again. I was fine and never had another seizure until the 11th of October 2013- I had not been doing any physical work and was hydrated - Feeling great. It Happened while I was driving and very lucky to survive the accident I had as a result of the seizure. I was taken to hospital, Had a full blood test, CT Scan, MRI and referred to a Neurologist where I had an EEG and was placed on 500mg of Keppra twice a day 12 hours apart. Also was banned from driving for 12 months. This pretty much ruined my life. As a result I lost my house, Job, Girlfriend & Many, Many, Many more things. In the meantime I continued to see my neurologist and had more blood tests and EEG scan which all as usual came back clear- I was in perfect health according the tests. It was around this time I had my dosage of Keppra increased to 1000mg as my Neurologist felt my levels needed to be higher. I have had roughly 5 seizures since the 11th of October 2013 - Each time I get a weird taste/smell in my nose after if that helps? Obviously my body is sore after and fatigued mentally and physically after- Sometimes I bite the side of my tongue during the seizure. Memory loss is also quiet common too. I can feel when the seizures are coming and have put together some exercises to help avoid the seizure which sometimes works & sometimes does not- I basically use very simple mathematical sums to distract myself and it brings me out of the seizure and has a strike rate of about 50% success. I know the seizure is coming because I feel very disoriented and confused and random memories come to mind with random thoughts which I have no control over.Keppra does not seem to be working and the tests are all coming back clear. I feel as though I lose intelligence every time I have another seizure and feel as though there are long term effects. Many if not all of you may feel/think this is sill also but I cannot tell my neurologist about any seizures because if I report another I will lose my license for 5 years instantly- My life is over at this point, I will not be able to survive. Pretty much screwed. I feel horrible for having to do this and have hinted as much information as I can to my neurologist and think he may understand what i'm trying to do hence raising/doubling my Keppra dosage.My mother has Epilepsy and but this was caused by a horse riding accident when she was a young girl and left her with a scar on her brain. So epilepsy is not in the family on my mothers side. As for my father- I do not know him, He ran out on my mother when I was 6 months old. However as far as we know he did not have any related medical issues.I'm a pretty active person and not overweight either- I'm 6.4"" and weight 84kg clothed so probably less if i were naked. I was anaemic when younger and as a result had low blood pressure and once fainted after standing to long for school photos. This was because of not enough meat in my diet but have since cleared that up and is no longer an issue Very sorry if I have rambled pointlessly but i'm trying to give as much information as I possibly can. I'm waiting eagerly for your responses.Thank you.","question"

First off if you are only having 5 seizures per year give or take a couple of  months, your seizures should be classified as under control. At one point I was having more than 5 a week. As for your anti-seizure pills not working. The only way to deal with that issue is to talk with your doctor. Keppra might not be the one that works best for you. Keppra did not work for me and I was taking around 3,000 mg a day. You might have to have a higher dose, another drug added along with Keppra or try something completely different. So sorry, you are just going to have to talk with your neurologist.","answer"

Having seizures *****! I've only had one seizure while driving, but I was at a red light and I almost always have an ""aura"" before, which allowed me to pull over safely. I live in Louisiana, previously in Mississippi and Minnesota, it sounds as if the laws are pretty similar: it's up to the doctor if he or she will report him to the DMV. I started having seizures out of the blue at age 24, and my doctors can only theorize that a possible cause was a very high fever due to spinal meningitis as a child. At the time of my first seizure, I was under a great deal of stress, not sleeping well, and I was taking a pain medication (Tramadol) that lowers one's seizure threshold. I was a full-time city bus driver, that was the only job I'd ever had, and I was comfortably middle-class on just my income. My doctor was more understanding than your husband's: he agreed not to report my seizure to the DMV but I had to immediately resign from my job (5 years, it was my career!) and permanently give up my CDL. It took a while to find a seizure medication that actually prevented my seizures. I was allergic to several, and most just didn't work. I take Depakote, I have now for nearly 12 years. When a person suddenly starts having seizures, it permanently changes his or her life. That's one thing that your husband has to accept, and it was hard for me, too. There's the constant uncertainty, wondering if today will be the day, or tomorrow? Priorities get shifted. Taking those medications to prevent a seizure becomes as important as eating. After I had to give up a job that I loved, I was faced with the bleak reality of being a high school graduate who only had job experience with one job, and I could no longer do it. It was impossible to pay for my medication, I had to sell my car because it basically cost a car payment every month to buy my meds, out of pocket. He has to learn what triggers his seizures, and listen to his body! I didn't do that at first, many times I'd fall from a standing position, which almost always led to a concussion, and sometimes some other injury. Every new concussion makes future seizures more likely. The headlights in traffic is a trigger for me, too. Lack of sleep, anxiety, some foods, medications, not eating (that was a dilemma I faced at times: I couldn't afford both Depakote and food, so I'd buy Depakote and have a seizure because I'd go a day or two without food)… There are as many triggers as there are sufferers. I'm afraid that your husband's driver's license is at the mercy of his doctor. It's now his job to make avoiding a seizure a very high priority in his life, and if that means setting alarms to remember his meds, that's what must be done. Yes, please find a different doctor, this one sounds horribly unsympathetic, but he is bound by law to report it. Perhaps a larger dose or using two different medications (mine is long-acting, it only has to be taken once daily) may help him more. I know it's horribly inconvenient but he needs to be as consistent as possible with his medications. If he were involved in an accident due to a seizure, it would be horrible for everyone involved, but completely preventable. And, it would be highly likely that he'd be faced with legal action. Try to convince his current doctor that he will not miss any doses of medication, show him what he is going to do in the future so this doesn't happen. We all know that it's still possible for him to have a seizure, even with anticonvulsant medication, but if he wishes to continue to drive, he owes it to the public to do everything he can to prevent himself from having an episode while driving. My last seizure occurred on January 19, 2012. I'd been out of my medication for one month, and I'd been unable to sleep for the previous two nights, and I had a feeling that it was going to happen. I thank God that I was getting gas when it happened. Still, I dislocated my right shoulder, had ANOTHER concussion, and broke my nose… again. The next day, I got a payday loan and filled my Depakote, and I've taken it every evening at 9:00 pm since that day. If that's what it takes to keep myself safe from having a seizure, I'll do whatever it takes to assure myself that I will have my meds. I'm praying for both of you, this takes a toll and it's so misunderstood. I'm sorry you and he are having to go through this.","answer"

As I posted in another post I think before his meds he was having absent seizures. We discussed them recently and he admitted to me that if he glances at the headlights of another vehicle headlights it messes with him. They had ran done test but he was on his meds by that point. I just want to help him.I feel like him having to take his meds make him feel weak. He has always had a quicker temper and stresses easily. But I can honestly say since his seizures he has worked on these traits. He also loved to drink but has stopped completely. The only thing that worries me is his meds.They keep switching what generic brand he is on. Plus I have read that he become immune to them. Is this true?

When they said that missing two doses would be all that it would take to cause his seizure they were correct, and that is most likely the reason. I just wanted you to know that just because he did miss the doses that there are other reasons that could of caused the seizure.If he is under allot of stress that can also cause a seizure even if he is taking his meds like he is suppose to and they can also happen for reason's that are unknown. I am also on Dilantin plus 4 other  seizure drug's and on top of that I have a device called a VNS stimulator If he has not done so I would recommend setting alarms to help remind him to take his meds at the same time every day if possible. Not taking them at the same time every day can also bring them on.As for your husbands doctor, find a new one if you are able to. If he is not willing to hear what you and and your husband has to say, that to me sounds like he does not care and just wants to get you out of his office.If you ever need someone to vent to just send me a note.

Also just because he missed taking his meds does not mean that was the reason for the seizure. The doctor is just trying to protect everyone and that includes you and your family.Unfortunately there is really nothing you can do.

I was on several medications before my neuroligist prescribed Lamictal which worked great at eliminating seizures. Initially, the Lamotrigrine(generic Lamictal) didn't work consistently. After exploring this further, I learned that manufacturers were required to have 90% active ingredients in the medication. The meds from certain countries(China and India) were marginally effective and I had a few ""breakthrough"" seizures. After switching to a UK manufactured product two years ago, I have been seizure free. The UK products had larger mounts of active ingredients.Absent an explanation for this aneurysm, it was speculated by the doctors that the aneurysm and subsequent brain bleed was associated with the bacterial infection that cause endocarditis within a few weeks of the TBI. My neuroligist told me it could have been caused by a concussion incurred decades earlier and it was exacerbated by the bacteria in my bloodstream.

My neurologist just informed me that Osteoporosis and shrinkage of the Cerebellum are very serious side effects for long term users of Dilantin. Does anyone know more about this?I've been taking 500mg of Dilantin for over 30 years since I was a teenager, and now I'm terribly worried. Not one of the neurologists had mentioned anything about this over the years, and now at 46, I've learned that I may have severe osteoporosis. Also go in for an MRI to evaluate the other side effect: Shrinkage of the Cerebellum, which I understand can cause issues with balance!Has anyone been through this before? I have not tolerated other meds well in past attempts to change to ""newer"" meds, and I'm being told I may HAVE to get off Dilantin. This may mean I will not have as good seizure control.

She was diagnosed with infantile spasms. No one would admit her seizures could have been linked to this shot, yet she has since been exempt from all future shots.  The pertussis was mentioned to me We tried every available drug at the time to try to gain control ( this was 16 years ago ).  Each drug brought on a new type of seizure...our last resort was the ketogenic diet, which broke the status, when jen was about 2 years old. jenna was left with brain damage.  She was put on depokote along with the diet which seemed to be the best control for jen for many years.All her life she still had brief myoclonic eye flutters, rolls, hard blinks, the body jerks ended.My main concern was to not let them cluster for fear of status again.Over the years...14 to be exact, jenna has been left to cluster all day at school.  The clusters happen a few times a year and usually brought on by illness.  I always use diazepam to break her clusters within 5 minutes of onset.The school and leaving her to cluster is a whole other story, complete neglect.I have since pulled jen from school to keep her safe, but her myoclonics have definitely increased,  Not sure if its due to the negligence of the school or her age.  She also started having grand mals approx. 5 years ago. I Also question if these grand mals weren't brought on by the neglected myoclonic clusters.Life has been a whirlwind.Jens myoclonics are now happening 100s if not 1000s of times a day.  As of now, her neuro is giving me a bit of time to try to settle them, Im beginning to become very nervous again, as I know the next step will be experimenting with new drugs.  I am aware there are many new anti convulsive drugs now  also jenna is 16 years older than when I last faced that horrifying ordeal .  I went alternative many years ago with the diet...it proved to be the only thing that saved her life.  The diet was considered very dangerous. I had to fight hard to get someone to help me.  There weren't enough ""studies"" done on it at the time.  Im once again faced with very few options.  Ive done some research on medical marijuana and am told by others that have children like my Jen...that it has saved their lives.  I live in NY...it has just been legalized here...but it is expected to not be much movement with it for 18 months.  I may not have that much time to wait.I have spoken to jens  neuro about it and as of now faced with the same words "" not enough study""Im seriously considering  moving to Michigan as I know they have clinics there for this purpose.Anyways ...Hope someone might be able to give me a bit of in sight.  Feeling very alone and overwhelmed right now.Thank You in advance","question"

I've been having them since I was about 10 years old. I have the mono-clonic & granmaw seizures. I was diagnosed with epilepsy when I was 15. I've had an MRI done and quite a few EEG's, blood work, and a cat scan done. And my neurologist has come up with nothing. I was put on keppra for a year. And of course when I went to go have my EEG done for that year check up. It came back clear. So they took me off. They weren't bad for a very long time and then all of a sudden they started happening again and more often and my mono-clonic seizures were gettin worse. Instead of just my eyes and head twitching and what not. My arms would jerk, and if I was standing my knees would always buckle. And I got tired of worrying bout when or if ones gonna happen. Worrying about if I stay up too late am I gonna have one. So I got put back on my medication. I'm 19 years old I've been back on it for about 6 months now. And still no known cause for my seizures, except flashy lights, sleep deprivation. I deal with horrible migraines and if I can't get rid of it, it'll make me have seizures, if I over work my body it'll cause me to have one. Is there anything Yall can tell me about what's wrong with my brain since my doctor doesn't know? And since it seems like to me I'm not gonna grow out of them what could I do to help with my seizures without having to be stuck on medication for the rest of my life.","question"

As for your EEG's coming back negative or clear, please do not worry about it to much. Where your seizure activity is located could be deep within your brain and a normal EEG might not pick it up. The best thing for you to do is to avoid anything that you know of that can trigger a seizure and stay on your meds. Also you will also most likely have to stay on some type of seizure medication throughout your life. I know that is not what you wanted to hear but, it is what it is. Try and avoid stress as much as possible because that can also be a trigger for seizures. I wish you luck","answer"

Breath 4 secs up through nose and breath 4 secs out through diaphragm. Hope this will help, keep me updated! Good luck from Carrie15","answer"

The medicine I was prescribed never helped and the sensations started getting worse. When I was about 23 I went to a neurosurgeon who tested to see if I could be operated on. A non-malignant tumour was discovered and I was eventually operated on. (The whole tumour could not be removed as it would had affected my memory). A year later I had my first seizure. Since then I have about 3 seizures a year, depending on the situation I'm in. I'm now 32 and last year discussed having a baby with my husband. I got a VNS inserted in Oct 2011 and in Jan 2012 I fell pregnant. Since then the seizures have gotten worse, I now have about 2 -3 a month. I increased my medication and have reduced my activities. This month I've had 2 other strange episodes and I don't know what they are, can anyone help me diagnose them? I started having them when I was about 14 and they're not very common, years can pass before I have another one. It usually happens when I'm laying down, I start feeling very heavy, my tongue then feels think, things then start to spin and then I get a repetitive loud sound spinning in my head. Things start to go crazy and worse. It lasts for minutes and I just have to wait for the feeling to pass.

I don't have any midnight binges and use portion control when I eat breakfast and dinner. I don't snack but I'm not real good at exercising. Does anyone have any info or been through anything like this that they could give me feed back on? I sure would be grateful and very hopeful as I am very miserable cause not only am I 179pds, I'm only 5ft. tall. This has a lot to do with my exercising cause it caused completed exhaustion.

I used to read a lot and also magazines or cientific topics.One feeling; ""I already passed through this"", ""I already live it"", ""i already dream this""...So this feeling to me makes me think that what im leaving is part Of my destiny and that was meant to be.. Or at the same time that my actions then aré correct.This feeling (about dreaming is so strong) that sometimes i would like to be so patient and constant and récord my dreams.  But at the end I don't need it.This explanation is part of a myth or spiritual believe in some cultures. (tribus)Now some of the scientific versions about this is that the brain is a muscle and at some point the muscle needs to relax.. Or rest.. And of course cannot stop functions.  Now I notice it can happen more often if I don't rest ( long period of times).  You live sometime thAt just happened... Your reality overlaps for those milliseconds ...

There can be several causes of this hypotonia like brain damage or encephalopathy due to lack of oxygen before or immediately after birth, defects in brain formation etc.Motor neuron diseases, muscular dystrophies are other  causes of hypotonia.Near term  delivery ,delayed milestones and associated movement, balance, and posture disorders all indicate the possibility of cerebral palsy in your child. Hypotonic CP is very rare compared to a spastic CP.Hypotonia is generally associated with damage to the cerebellum which controls balance and coordination. Any insult or damage to the growing brain can lead to developmental delays. Treatment for this condition is only symptomatic and supportive. Treatment of the associated symptoms, physiotherapy and early intervention programs are helpful. Do discuss your concerns with a Pediatric neurologist. He will be able to suggest best after clinical examination. Hope it really helps.Best wishes!","answer"

LGIT is different than the low glycemic diet you hear about for wt loss. In general Low Glycemic foods help to keep blood sugar even and helps to prevent those highs and lows. The treatment for epilepsy is like keto in that it is low carb and limits carbs, but of the carbs allowed, they must be low glycemic and again ... must be done only through a trained doctor (blood work needs to be done frequently).Here is another link to a site called Matthews Friends:http://site.matthewsfriends.org/Matthews Friends is a site primarily about keto and related diets, but there is also an online parent forum and I believe there are also kids there that have gluten sensitivity.On the Matthews Friends site, you can find a good article on LGIT as well as a slide show on LGIT.As far as homeopathic docs ... be careful there. We went down that route and one of the homepathic remedies triggered a huge status seizure in my daughter. Status seizures mean prolonged and require emergency intervention.If you do decide to go that route ... try and find a DAN! doc. they really seem to understand celiacs. There are many MDs that are now DAN!s. I think finding a good GI doc and/or allergist that understands and has an interest in celiacs might be a good idea.In any case, those links to parent groups might help you find other parents that are dealing with both epilepsy  and celiacs.I think it is great that you are trying to figure the big picture.","answer"

We are not yet convinced that her seizures are due to gluten sensitivity. But it will help if you continue giving her gluten free diet. Currently, there are tests which can diagnose celiac disease, or gluten sensitivity. These tests can be correlated to EEG findings and clinical symptoms. These are genetic tests and can be done at specialized laboratories. Your daughter's seizures are most likely to be atonic seizures. The discomfort in her throat could actually be due to loss of muscle tone during an episode. There are quite a few voluntary muscles in and around the throat. A sudden loss of tone in these muscles may produce such a symptom. I am not able to explain to you the mechanism of it. This is just a hypothesis. This is a rare symptom. Regards","answer"

It was very hard to remember things, like words and if verbally asked to do something it just slipped from my memory all the time. I didn't like it.So I switched to Keppra ONLY, it was good that it relieved the mental fog. BUT over the year or so I took it, I felt VERY low emotionally, to the point of no motivation, mental strength or energy to do even basic things, like plan a meal. It was horrible and depressing. I wasn't functioning. It took time for me to associate it to the drug. So now I take both together and find it's a much better balance. But back to you - taking all those meds, there's a good chance you'll have at least mild side effects. But it can take a while before you realise that something is not the same. If you notice you're feeling different, then write down those things.I also go online and check the side effects of each drug, and whether you have any. You are the best one to know your body and mind and pass that information to your doctor if it's not right.I think the medication kind of 'numbs' the seizure areas of our brain, so that kind of numbs or slows down our mental function a bit.

Sometimes doctors start withv igabatrin (Sabril) which is often used as the initial therapy because it is relatively safe (especially for short-term use) and effective. If vigabatrin does not control the seizures in 3 or 4 days, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) is usually used next. ACTH stops seizures in more than half of children with infantile spasms. Often the baby will be given another anti-epileptic drug after the spasms have stopped and the ACTH therapy has been completed.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.","answer"

Geez you really have had it hard haven't you. Sorry to hear all that. If you do go off the tablets suddenly and not continue on them, then there will more than likely be a chance that you will never be able to control your epilepsy at all and so that will mean all your independence will be gone and you will have to rely on other people but you will not want that and it will frustrate the other people as they will know that there is something you can do about it and that is to take medication. I know taking medication is a horrible thing, trust me, I hate it. I rebelled against it years ago and the only place it got me was the ICU ward in hospital. I learned my lesson pretty quick after a couple of trips there. Pretty scary when you are 16yrs old and you wake up in the ICU ward not knowing why you are there. I have been told that every seizure you have, you kill off a brain cell but I don't know how true that is. I do a lot of puzzles and read a lot to keep my mind active to make sure I am not going to lose my mind. My advice to you about your medications is to not stop taking them but to either see another neurologist that will be straight forward with you that will look at what else is wrong with you and give you something that won't interfere with anything that you are on now or anything that may make you ill although it is trial and error every time as I have found out. I think my neurologist has been taking stabs in the dark with me to be honest as he has put me on the 4 different types of tablets but I am controlled and I am thankful for that as I can lead a normal life but it still scares me at times and it upsets me quite often like I said. Have you had any blood tests to confirm all your organs are ok from the tablets? I know you said you had problems with your liver so that will show problems but other organs. Just remember you are not alone. xo","answer"

Like Flipper, I have multiple types of seizures which is classed as Generalised Epilepsy. So there is no way out of it but to take tablets for it. I don't like taking them either. I have been taking them since I was 7yrs old and have been on so many different ones and my neurologist has now got me on 4 different types (Epilim, Lamictal, Topamax & Keppra). I have found since going on the Keppra (as I didn't go on all these at the same time), I have had many changes in myself. I am now feeling the cold worse for about 10 mths out of the year. So I feel like a freak when I am out sometimes. I am feeling more lethargic, irritable, get upset easier, I could go on for a few more things but you get the picture. But also like Flipper said, mj is not the way to go as it can have an effect on the tablets you are on. They can muck up the dosage of what you are supposed to be having just like certain other tablets you can get over the counter. I have grown to live with this over the past 27yrs but at times I still get scared, angry and also feel alone as I don't feel that I have anyone to talk to about it cause I feel that their is no one that knows what I am going through.

I've always had not the best memory, but now in the past 4-5 months its gotten to a point where its negatively impacting my life on a daily basis; I can't remember things I've done with my friends, inside jokes, people I've met, what a movie I watched a month ago was about. Every day when someone says ""Remember this happened.."" It could have been years ago, or a month ago and I can never remember. It makes me want to cry because I am so frustrated and constantly find myself saying ""Umm no, I don't, I have a bad memory."" It's impacting my University career, I am struggling to remember things, and when I try to remember information I've learned in previous classes in previous years it just upsets me because I can't remember anything and feel like the past 3 years has been a waste. Here are the other issues though; I have struggled with bulimia for the past 8 years. In the past 3 months I realized this was something I want to seriously get rid of for various reasons, and have been eating a more balanced diet, trying to ensure I have proper nutrients, and have minimized purging to about once a week. I have also always taken multivitamins in attempt to avoid vitamin deficiencies(which I am aware can impact memory). Despite eating healthily in the past few months, there has been no improvement in my memory. The second issue is that I have epilepsy. I have myoclonic seizures and sometimes grandmals, that were mostly controlled by medications for years. I switched medications last september however, he started me on a lower dosage and said he would probably need to raise it in the spring, but when I called to make an appointment, my neurologist had no openings until next January, and my family doctor would not raise it. About a month before or around the same time my memory problems started, there was a period of 2 months where my epilepsy got extremely bad. I was having grand mal seizures twice a week and was always exhausted, but after 2 months I decided to raise my medication dosage on my own because I couldn't function normally and no one would help me with my medication. I incrementally increased my keppra dosage of 250 mg twice daily to 500mg twice daily, and my seizures completely stopped within 2 weeks and I have been seizure free for about 3-4 months, but am still experiencing memory issues. I am thinking that these memory issues were caused by that period of time when I was experiencing so many grand mal seizures, but am concerned because it just seems to be getting worse despite being seizure free. I am wondering if I am on the right track, or if it could it be something completely different, I just don't understand why it's getting worse and not better, and the walk in doctor said it was not a side effect of the keppra medication. Could that spell of seizures have caused damage in my brain, and if so will it get better? Or do you think it is something else? My family doctor just said to see my neurologist and keep eating on a  balanced diet, but my next appointment with my neurologist is January 2014, and I don't know what else to do at this point. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.","question"

She is also of the same age (9 years and 10 months) and has been diagnosed with 's/o genralised epilepsy' by her neuro who did a hour long sleep deprived VEEG on her only this month. Her brain MRI with Contrast is absolutely normal. Prior to this there were two episodes of sudden falling (one per year and that too during the peak summer periods during morning school assembly and though we approached her Paediatrics also as well as the Neuro but then also the EEG (it was routine for 15-30 minutes and was conducted four -five days after the episode) was done and as it was normal, the episode was discarded as syncope attack. This time two months back, she woke up suddenly in the middle of her sleep and was 'disoriented' for few seconds with a puzzled look and was not able to recognize her mother or me but then in a fleeting moment it was all over, She went to the washroom and was normal and continued with her sleep. Then It was again and this time in July while playing in the school playground at 1250 hrs in the noon she had this 'seizure' wherein her friends reported that all of a sudden she sat quite, and was hitting her thighs and head with both of her arms a few times not very hard, was not able to recognize one of her friends and was complaining of headache. She was relating to the activities during this period like when she was offered water, she drank, walked with her friends from the play ground to the staffroom which was on the first floor, the teacher observed her weak and drained-off, she asked her to be in front of cooler and after a while she went back to her class and attended the two lectures before the school was off. She came to home completely drained off and slept without having anything. She is sharp and above average in her studies and normally scores A and A+ grades n her class, has secured first position for three consecutive levels of ABACUS and dancing is her passion. She initially use to get confused with 'b' and’d’ and 'on' and 'no' but that was that, now she no more confuses with these letters or words.She has now been prescribed with 'Valparin Chrono 300mg' one in the morning and one in night for two years and the doctor (Neuro) will see her after a month's time. She has been advised normal siezure precautions like no swimming, but is allowed to continue with her dance classes.Also she complains of severe stomach pain some times around the naval, this is chronic, I mean every 6-8 months, a day or two are when she complains, her ultrasound report for the whole abdomen is absolutely normal, she loves to go to school and does not wish to miss it even with the stomach aching.  My concern is if the diagnosis and the medicinal course she is put on with are correct and what are the chances of total cure in such cases. Thanks in advance for responses in advance,","question"

Nevertheless, I value any suggestion here which helps me understand this health condition, I mean Epilepsy. The stomach pain is not because of the medicines as the medicine has only started a few weeks whereas, as I mentioned, the stomach pain is much older and random in nature. She has also been diagnosed with mild Iron deficiency and has been prescribed with iron supplement. A little loss of appetite is there, but that's seem to be ok and most probably temporary in nature. This may be due to the medicines also, I presume. I am also thinking of taking a second advise on the medicinal course she has been put to. She is otherwise doing fine.","answer"

I had a seizure when I was 12 years old. In fact, I had two in the same day back then. They consisted of me tensing up, being unable to move, and eventually fainting. I've never had one since...However, 13 years later, I've had some strange things happen to me, though significantly different enough for me to wonder whether these are seizures or not. I have them happen around 3-4 times a month, and there seems to be no trigger for them.They usually consist of:-a feeling of dread and helplessness-wanting to run out of a room; claustrophobia-inability to think or talk without effort. Though when I do talk, its usually fine and coherent... though I'd prefer just not to talk-mind racing but not thinking about anything in particular-usually the need to go to the bathroom or a stomach ache-a slight headache though not terrible. More like pressure behind eyes and in forehead.-legs, arms, and body feel very sensitive, clammy, and stiff (but my muscles are not tensed or anything -- its more of a nerve-feeling).-inability to remain lying down or sitting. I have to stand or walk -- preferably walk-no appetite. the thought of eating is terrible-increase in my normal visual snow-general panicThese episodes usually take place when I'm sleep deprived or stressed. They also usually last between 30-40 minutes max. They get better after I use the restroom, interestingly. I also feel the need to call someone on the phone and have them calm me down. Could these be seizures? I don't lose any consciousness during them.","question"

I was reffered to the wrong specialist (apparently) who diagnosed panic attacks and the Dr wanted me to have a second opinion at the seizure clinic which I haven't received yet.I just feel like I'm now losing my mind with all of this activity, almost as if my brain is disintegrating away. I am losing my personality, I used to be very bubbly, happy and life loving but now I am having so many of these attacks that I'm either 'in' an attack, just had an attack or worried about the possibility of taking one.They all start the same way, last the same amount of time - more or less and make me feel the same type of things.First (my partner has told me) my mood will drop all of a sudden, he said that it 'changes' sometimes i can become very happy or excited but most of the time its a drop in mood.Then I can become confused, not able to string sentences together, not able to follow conversation, easily distracted.Then I start having sensory issues; I can't bear to have music on in the car if im out at the time, or the TV if im inside, I can't handle loud noises, too much talking - my brain can't seem to process anything quite fast enough, I start getting irritable, depressed or really angry.These are never small feelings of anger or irritability, happiness or sadness - these feelings start of minute, almost un noticeable and then all of a sudden they are so strong they affect my breathing, it can feel like all of a sudden im the worst person in the world, my world is falling a part and I don't know what to do. I never know what to do with myself - if I come in and the TV is off I wont be able to turn it on because I will be so confused as to what my mind 'wants'.This is about the 20th minute of attack that this starts. I may start pacing or I may stay sitting and rock/fidget/sway - the tics will start after I've started pacing or that - they are where my body all of a sudden jerks in a specific part - its usually always the right side, right leg or right arm. There will be an intense feeling in my stomach and a pressure on the balls of my feet then my legs will jump up (as if I have had an electric shock) - they will continue, Im still in and out mostly. There are times when I know exactly where I am but most times I have no memory after the tics - they get worse and more frequent and more...scary.On the times that I have tried to walk or become mobile afterwords  - my left leg doesn't seem to work properly. I look like im limping/dragging my foot and this will last anywhere from a short period of time to a long period of timeI will get patchy goosebumps on my right arm all of a sudden lasting a few seconds when I have come to, I will feel like my skin is almost crawling and i look down I have funny shaped patches of goosebumps on my right arm.Mobility is severely impaired a lot during and after, two nights ago I had the worst attack i've ever had and I couldn't stand up from the couch without becoming light headed, let the dogs outside and walk up or downstairs. I had to lean all my weight on my left side while pulling myself up the banister and walking down is worse - its almost as if I have no control over the muscles - I can't engage them to work properly.After the attack I can be ok, but sometimes I can be really tired. All of a sudden while im having jerks they will slow down and my mind will 'fizz' back in to reality. Within a second or two everything makes sense again, I have the mental capacity to plan, organize, decide, eat, prepare, walk and move.Sometimes however I can be very tired, the day after my worst attack I slept for 17 hours, I couldn't wake up - everytime I tried I was drunkenly falling back asleep.Generally that is every attack more or less. Occasionally I will experience the first half until the jerks where my body may go a bit rigid and my right arm will raise and I will curl in to a ball and shake. I can only feel pressure and its dark but I am aware of where I am - I can't talk or ask for help.Most of the time my eyes also seem to force themselves shut (like a tic) continuosly as this happens but more so on the jerking part.All in all this will be almost garaunteed to stop an hour after it started (almost to the minute), sometimes it can be very short but i've looked at my reactions so much and written so much down that I can now tell within 10 minutes that its about to start. I don't know why I can tell but all of a sudden I'll look at my watch and keep time.I was wondering if anyone had experienced similar, if anyone had any advice or ideas?I have been seeing a nutritionist who has changed my diet to fit my body needs and deficiencies but this hasn't stopped the attacks.Im still waiting on an appointment with the neurologist but I now feel like Ive had a bad run of it in the last few weeks and im dead with it all. I can hardly keep up to my routine and its getting me down - all I want to do is go to bed but it makes me feel so lazy, Im worried my partner thinks i'm crazy because I don't know whats going on in my head he must feel so useless as well.I don't know how to control or deal with the attacks, they frighten me a lot. In fact I think Tuesday night traumatized me after sleeping 17 hours I kept crying for no reason, I was confused actually - I felt like I had been drugged. It's not a nice feeling to have when you're confused and I hate it to no end.If anyone can help -I would be so greatful. I can't handle much more of it without an answer yet it still seems so far off.","question"

As an adult,epilepsy didn't prevent me from getting married or having 3 beautiful daughters;but the limitations(stress,sleep & diet) never changed.Plus,even though my seizures are controlled,there's the fear that if I were driving an accident could happen;besides the higher insurance costs~~so I've never learned to drive.I hate being dependant on others!","answer"

Few people may experience anxiety, panic due to the condition itself or as effect of medications. Memory and concentration may become poor in few people. They may feel stressful to go out or swim for the fear of having a seizure. Taking medications daily and if they are told not to drive can affect them a lot. It is important to cope up with the condition and accept it. Take your medications regularly. Exercise daily and have a balanced diet. This will increase your energy levels and boost your immune system which reduces risk of seizures. Do write to me again.Best luck and regards!","answer"

I would mention this to your doctor, however your decision to stop meds was not entirely irrational. It is quite possible you won't have another siezure. It is possible that your siezures were a result of you hitting ""that one spot"". The most important thing is that you won't hurt yourself or injure others as a result of a seizure. Therefore you should not drive for at least a year. In general after a year free from seizures and medications driving priviliges are restored. Epileptic seizures can result from many different etiologies, from structural damage to genetic sensitivity to certain chemicals. It is a good sign you have not had seizure activity. I would discuss this with your physician because it will document your ability to live without medication, which has legal consequences if you drive.","answer"

I say was because hes begun having relapses after being alcohol free for nearly a year. Last year in August he began having seizures and they diagnosed him with epilepsy 6months later after ruling out alcohol withdraw. He was banned from driving until he was seizure free for 6months. After much trial and error he was finally placed on medication that works for him and just this past May he was cleared to not only drive his car but to resume any driving activity at work.Unfortunately, he has begun to relapse. The same day his Dr cleared him to drive, he dropped me and our boys off at the playground and was supposed to come pick us up. After 3hrs of waiting, I realized he wasnt coming back and thankfully found a friend to take myself and 2 tired and hungry boys home. This same friend took me back to the playground so I coukd wait in vain for my hubby to come back. I then got a phone call from him telling me he was at a local bar but he swore he wasnt drinking but just having a pepsi. I knew he was lying and my friend took me to said bar where my suspicions were confirmed. He was trashed.Then this Friday he got off work and it was payday. He called to tell me he was ""stuck in traffic"" and would try to be home by 8p. When it was 830p I called him and got no answer. My gut instinct came into play - I knew he was up to no good. Sure enough I found him at the same bar, drinking alcohol. He had money for our car payment so I walked in and demanded the money then left him there. I was LIVID this is the biggest ""**** you"" he has done to me. After I had to take him to work every morning RIGHT after I got off at 6am then pick him up every night he got off at varying times. Whats worse is his lying about it on top of it all. Then he asks if Im mad at him... which of course I am but I just telk him I didnt want to talk about it. Why? Because I know it will start a huge fight and he will leave to god knows where until god knows when.Come Monday I am going to call his Dr and let her know what hes been doing. I am doing this because I am worried about him despite how badly he pisses me off. Im scared he will have more seizures and that one of these days he will be hurt badly by a seizure.What should I watch out for? How will his relapses be with his meds?","question"

B12 deficiency is easily detected and easily treated, but the medical profession is largely unaware of the danger, and few patients are screened for it.""","answer"

Epilim’s main component is sodium valproate, indicated for the treatment of epilepsy.  The usual side effects of this drug are: nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea frequently occur at the start of treatment. These problems can usually be overcome by taking Epilim with or after food. Cutaneous reactions such as rash rarely occur with valproate. Sedation has been reported occasionally, usually when in combination with other anticonvulsants. Rare cases of lethargy and confusion occasionally progressing to stupor, sometimes with associated hallucinations or convulsions have also been reported.

I hated the seizures too. The younger whe was, the more I cried after she had gone to sleep when it was over. If it was a bad one, I would panic. It's just horrible, and you feel so helpless because there really is just nothing you can do. But being strong and constant for them is something that you can do. I always talk softly and calmly to Jasmine while she's having a seizure, and if she's conscious, I always smile every time she looks at me and stroke her head, arms, or legs. Who kows what they can hear or feel, and if my soothing voice comforts her at all, then she knows I'm there and that it's going to be alright. I always try to make the day as normal as possible after a seizure so she doesn't worry. But I do give her extra time, and will read a story or just sit with her and watch a film if she's wacked out from it.She hated the bloods with a passion too. She would scream the place down, it was awful. How bad does it make you feel? It's another of those horrible situations where you know it's the right thing to do, but you instinctively feel the need to protect them from it. Keep a check on how he's reacting to the drug increase. There are many different drugs to try, and if he doesn't respond to this one, there are plenty of other ones out there. Intractible does mean they can't stop the seizures completely, but my little girl is now down to about 3 a month, which is brilliant. If he becomes too dopey and unresponsive on the meds, it's time to chat about changing them. Jasmine was a virtual zomby for a long while, when they tried a new med, it was like turning on a switch, and I kicked myself for not mentioning it sooner!! Sometimes they have to get used to the stuff and then it gets better, but never be afraid to mention what you're thinking to your doctor. It might be 10 times a no, then the next time it might be that it's time for a change.He sounds an absolute sweety, I can picture him playing with his little golf set lol. And that's great news too, he's learning words, and he's co-ordinated, so that's 2 positives!! He's responsive and happy, another 2!! It's such a dark time, but try to look at what he can do as well, it does help.I don't know how to start the facebook group, I'll look into it and let you know.Jasmine is 7 now, and getting better all the time.

"VNS","https://www.medhelp.org/posts/Epilepsy/VNS/show/796546","Fable","2009-04-30T12:57:22-04:00","Maybe we could start up a facebook group so we can chat about things?The beginning is the absolutely worst time. Watching your precious little bundle have seizures, regressing, taking all these chemicals is soul destroying. My little girl had epilepsy from birth, her first seizure was on the day I had her. In fact, I could feel her seizing in the womb, her being my 4th, I knew what I could feel wasn't right, far too rhythmic, but of course, I just got patted on the head and told I was just an overanxious mum to be. The regression is a recurring thing with Jasmine, she has passed her little milestones over and over again. She would learn to sit up, then the seizures would take it away, so she would relearn, over and over. The same with crawling, walking, and talking. She finally gave up with the talking because like everything else, she wouldn't know she couldn't do it any more, and would just go to do what she thought she could and always fall down. But with the talking, it somehow affected her more, and eventually she gave up, and wouldn't try. Maybe it was an awareness thing, and she knew what was going to happen, so there was no point. The long postictals are horrible. You worry how long before normal reappears, or if it even will. All Jasmine's EEG's have been normal too. She has a condition called unilateral closed lip schizencephally, which is what has caused her seizures. Have you had a diagnosis with a name? I would be much easier for you to research if they can give you something tangible to look for. It may not change anything, but at least you don't feel so helpless. Also, join an epilepsy forum. One that is only for epilepsy. I'm in the uk, and the one over here is epilepsy action, that way, you get up to the minute knowledge, loads of stuff to read, and more importantly, people who are going through the same thing. You will feel so much better when you find that person who has the same diagnosis.I will tell you what the prof who looks after Jasmine told me when she was 5 months old, and I swear it's what kept her brain functioning as well as it does.What you do now, is important. Don't treat him as special, make him work for everything. There is a large portion of the brain that is unused, and if you can stimulate it, it might take over from some of the damaged areas.With that advise, from that moment on, I never bought another toy that didn't have work to do for the reward. I never helped her reach things, or gave up and did stuff for her. I pushed her very hard, and it worked. She still regresses, and I still make her do everything for herself. I'm not an ogre, and there are obviously things I don't make her do, if she's exhausted from a seizure, I wouldn't expect her to walk anywhere, but I would still expect her to do everything else. All I wanted to do was wrap her up in cotton wool, but it would have been the worst thing I could have done for her. Her achievements, no matter how small, lit up my world, and my pleasure at her achievements, lit up hers. It's a two way street, and you have the traffic light controller!!It will get better, and knowledge is the key. The more you know, the more in control you feel. Don't go and drive yourself crazy researching everything, you'll just scare yourself - speaking from experience!! But if you can pin down a diagnosis, then you can start to work out what the future holds. As it's intractible epilepsy, so be it. You can start to plan, work out what to do to make things better for you both (all, if you have a hubby and other children). Speak to your neuro about the VNS. I'm not sure they do it in such young children, but again, you're making plans, doing something positive. If you are up for VNS at a later date, then you can start to plan around that. I know how devastating this is for you, but you're not alone, and we know the pain you're feeling.Take care, and a big cuddle for your little man,Fable xx","answer"

My little girl is thin too, I think it's all the seizure activity, when you think of all that muscle use every time they seize, it's no wonder. I was told that it may show now, but being girls, when they develop breast tissue, it wont be noticeable. You don't notice it so much after a while, now that the scars aren't so red, it doesn't shout out so much. I'm not suprised whe doesn't want to be touched, my little one was the same, she was very uncomfortable for about a week, but once it started to settle, she surprised herself I think. She was so sure it was going to hurt for ever, and was very surprised when she could lift her arm and there was no pain lol. Luck for your little one not having any staples, I wish they hadn't given mine any. I think that was as traumatic as the surgery for her. They took them out after only a week, so it was still very sore, and to have to undergo that was cruel. I don't know why they didn't give her a sedative. I read about the depression side of things with the implant, so at least they wont get down about things!! I'll book us a couple of beds, we can get a couple of nights sleep, and a built in happy pill. sounds great!!My little one says it tickles when it pulses. Not as a general rule, but when they first turn it up, and when I use the magnet. It tickles and makes her cough. It doesn't hurt her at all, she just doesn't like the feeling. She doesn't notice it if she's seizing, only if she's having a prolonged post ictal, or like I said, when they first increase it. I've never heard about the passing your tongue over a battery!! Yuck! so far, she's not had a problem with it at all.

Now I just have to get my ulcer checked!! LOL Thank you for the advice on the baggy clothes for her trip home. She would have never endured the 3 hour drive in her usual zip-up jammies! She is sore and still pretty uncomfortable. She has always loved the bath, but she can't have one for about two weeks so I am sad that she has little comfort. She doesn't really want to be held, or even touched. She is so cuddly usually, and the other kids want so much to make her feel better by stroking her or holding her, but she just not want to be bothered. I tell them to be patient, when she starts to heal, she will be all over them again. The Neurologist is going to turn her VNS on in 2 weeks. I would be a basket case by 6 weeks! LOL Canyon is so thin, that the device is really noticeable. As far as looks go, I don't care. I just worry about it sticking out so much. The surgeon suggested a protective vest until she puts on a little more weight. What do you think?I was surprised to find out that all of her stitches are desolvable. Gee, I am just so excited! She is pretty crabby to the other kids at school too! I did learn that the VNS is also implanted and actually started for the treatment of severe depression. That explains why all these seizure patients are so happy now! (maybe I'll get one!) LOLWell, thank you again and I will let you know how she is doing. I would love to see a picture of your sweet girl if you are comfortable with that. Tell her to keep up the good work in school! KIT  Oh, one more question....What does your little girl say it feels like when it pulses? Since Canyon can't talk and any one else I have heard from are adults, I wonder what a child says it is like. Cyberonics said it feels like eating ""Pop-Rocks"", someone else said it feels like putting a 9 volt battery to your tongue. What does she say?","answer"

I got to see the professor that was doing the op, and now a sister who deals with all the switching up. I was told this is best for drops, but they also tell you it can take up to a year to reach its full potential. The hardest part is waiting for it to be turned up to a therapeutic level - you get all excited because it's 6 weeks until they switch it on, then you have to wait another 4 for them to start switching it up, I was chomping at the bit by then. I've found it has cured 90% of the side issues she had. The anger, frustration, temper, aggression, exaggerated emotions, the way she would go out of her way to not do what was asked of her. She is much less easily distracted at school, her reading has improved no end, she is happy in class, whereas she would normally scowl at the other kids lol. And the nightmares are hardly there now. Her aura before a fit would be a really nasty hallucination, but now, she barely has them.She would see spiders all over her, witches, or whatever topic they were doing in school. I think her being less sleep deprived has made a big difference to her too. I sooo hope you get some sleep. It's bloody awful to start with lol, you get some sleep, and you're more tired than you were when you were running on auto pilot lol. I went into it not expecting anything, because no drugs have ever worked to control things, so to people like you and me, who have so much to deal with, anything is a blessing. You'd be surprised how quickly you forget how bad it was once things get better! Make a list of absolutely everthing, then, when you don't think much is happening, go and check that list, even something small that's not happening anymore can give you such a boost.I understand completely what you mean about the other children. Mine have always loved her too, and I've had to make sure they don't tailor their lives around her difficulties, which of course is hard, because we're so tired!! Now, my little one (Jasmine) is 7, her next oldest brother is 15 older sister of 16, and big brother of 24. The worry has got so much less for them, they can accept things more easily. It does give them a wonderful outlook on life having experienced a sister with special needs, I am so proud of them. They are so caring, to all children, I think there are positives in all things, and one of them for our situation is seeing that nurturing blossom in our other children. Without it, they would have much more of a selfish streak, as is natural for kids. You have to thank yourselves for that, without you being the kind of parents you are, and teaching them about life, dealing with Canyon Hope, they wouldn't be the children they are today. And you're obviously doing it right, because they worry about her, instead of feeling jealous and left out. No easy task with no sleep!! If things are bad, I always tell my kids we're circling the wagons, and that we all look out for each other. We obviously have the same outlook. Of course I don't mind you reading my entries out, there's nothing private in this thread, anything to help. I think the men can easily get forgotten in all this. They have a lot to cope with too, after all, she's his baby too! I wonder how often he gets a hug, I bet not as much as we do. Not long now!!  I went and had lunch in the hospital canteen when Jasmine went down to theatre, and browsed the hospital shops, bought her a singing flower, that I could strangle now lol, and tried to read magazines. Sounds great in theory, but I just couldn't concentrate!! Ooh, one thing I forgot to mention, when you pack for her, remember that there is an incision under the arm, and on the neck, so when they come to check the dressing, and when you come to put on her nightclothes or going home clothes, you need either shoe string straps with a loose underarm, or something baggy under the arms. And she might not be able to lift her arm after, so bear that in mind when you pack her going home clothes.I'm getting excited for you!! Take care,Fable xx","answer"

I don't think they have ever felt anything but love toward her and her situation, but as a mother I long for them to worry more about losing teeth or sleepovers, rather than their sick sister.

Her condition is called unilateral, closed lip, schizencephally, and if you read the prognosis on that, I have no idea why she is as well as she is. Both conditions have very difficult prognoses. She was diagnosed at 5 months, after me pushing and pushing to get someone to listen to me. She's my 4th child, so I kinda knew what I was talking about by then, but nobody would listen to me. She was fitting in my womb, I knew, and when I tried to get help, they just told me she was having hiccups. Grrrrr. I know what hiccups feels like after 4!! It took me actually filming her having a seizure before anyone would take notice. Her first seizure was on the day I had her. But they didn't believe me!! They told me it was natural to be anxious when a baby is first born. She went on to have drops when she was first home, I thought she had died, you know, that rag doll thing, light goes out in the eyes. They told me she had colic LMAO, then a milk allergy!!  When she was diagnosed, her doctor had a conversation with me I will never forget. She sat me down and told me about her condition, then said that there were ways that I could help her, and that there was so much of the brain that was unused, that if I pushed her really hard, I might be lucky, and that part of the brain might take over. Well from that moment onwards I made her poor little life hell!! lol. She had left sided weakness because her lesion is on the right side of her brain, so I used to put the bottle in her mouth, and then let go, she would instinctively raise both hands, so I would position them on the bottle properly, and then let go again. On and on we went with this. She used to get so frustrated, but she did it! And I never looked back. Every thing I ever did with her, I made her have to do some herself. Obviously she was very lucky in that she had been developing normally up to that point, and that's why she told me to do it, so that I maintained her brain function to the best of my abilities. Even then, I was told the best I could ever hope for was her in mainstream education but with a care asssistant with her at all times, but that it was unlikely she would make it to mainstream. That woman was the best thing that could have happened. It may have made my little ones childhood one long battle, but it worked!Jeez, those other sites. I've been on some, and I know what you mean. Let's focus on what they can do, and how to help each other, not what they can't do! We all know their lives are tough, but they're still our gorgeous little children, and just that smile you get in the morning is enough to wash away the night before. That's one thing I just love the VNS for. I haven't had a proper night's sleep in 7 years. But now, there are nights when I go to sleep, and actually wake up the next morinng!! Yayy!! I think the drops are the worst ones. Your poor little girly, I remember it well. Mine had them worst of all when she was 2. She would do the same, just as if someone had turned the switch off, bang, on the floor, always head hitting the hardest. It's horrible. Like I said though, there was a little boy in having a VNS the same time as mine, and he has had a real difference in the amount of drops he's been having. I don't know the actual amounts, because of course, theyre not allowed to discuss other patients, but I know it's been a great success, they told me that much. It hasn't taken them away completely, but it has made a big difference.I'm in the UK, so quite some distance!! But it's great to chat, and I'm keeping everything crossed for your VNS, just keep asking, I'm 6 months in now, so I've got that crystal ball thing going on lol.Take CareFable xx","answer"

She has busted out 4 teeth, received more than one major concussion, and knocked herself unconscious many times. You are very lucky! are you aware of the statistics on infantile spasms? It's something like over 80% of children who have had them end up being severely mentally retarded and suffer from all sorts of brain injury. For your little girl to be still mainstreaming is WONDERFUL!!! Where are you from? I have so enjoyed having someone to exchange info with.

Just shows how much you love her.My little girl (7) has drop attacks, absences, partials, and tonic clonic. When she was a baby, she had Infantile Spasms, and I think she had Wests Syndrome, but her prof wont lable her, because she says that labelling her with a syndrome isn't always the way to go. This is because she is not mentally challenged, she is a bit behind, but not enough to drop her down a year, or take her out of mainstream education. Before the VNS, she could have anything up to 3 major seizures, 4 drop attacks and 3 absences in a day. She goes up and down with her seizures, she can have a really good spell, then it all comes  back. Since the VNS, the seizures are much weaker, and most times, I can be back in bed in literally 5 minutes!! She starts seizing, I go in, swipe the magnet a couple of times, and that's that!! She does still have the ones that the magnet doesn't control sufficiently, but these are rare, and I think personally, that if it wasn't for the device, she would be having a really bad run of them at that time, and it's actually holding it all at bay. We also haven't had it turned up as far as it can go yet!! The drop attacks have stopped altogether, the absences are only when she's ill or very tired, and the partials are tonics are much less as well. She now averages 3 seizures a week, but her recovery is just brilliant. Instead of being post ictal for ages, as soon as the seizure's over, it's over, no after effects. Before surgery, she could be stuck in a seizure for 3 - 4 days.The device hasn't been an issue at all. It was sore to start with, naturally, but no, I can pick her up under her arms just the same, I just have to be aware that it's there, because I think sometimes it may press on her when I lift her, but apart from that, you wouldn't even know she had it. Nothing damages it, you just can't hang around the xray machines at airports, but that's actually a good thing, because they give you a piece of paper to carry around explaining that, and you just go straight through!!  No probs with microwaves or anything like that, I wouldn't know about metal detectors, but unless they have a very strong magnet in them, which I don't believe they do, that shouldn't matter. You get given 2 magnets, one for the school and one for you. The school will get trained in how to use them, make sure you set up an appointment to chat with them about it. They come with a velcro wrist strap for you to either wear it, or attach it to something, but because of the very strong magnet, you can't have it close to your pc, phone, or credit cards. Out of everything, that has been the hardest thing to remember lol. Don't worry about asking, ask anything you like, I'm only too pleased to help.Take CareFable xx","answer"

I wasn't ignoring you, I just didn't know. Ok, well when she comes back from theatre, she will have roughly, a 10cm wound under her arm. My daughter had staples there, and there were 15 of them. They are very close together, so don't be allarmed at the number, but I wished someone had told me more of what to expect when my little girl had it done. You are far more prepared mentally when you don't get any surprises I think. She will have redness and brusing tracking from that, up to her neck, where they have fed the wires to connect to the vagus nerve. On her neck, will be a similar sized wound, but that was held together with self disolving internal stitches and those sterry strip things (sorry, I don't know how to spell it!!) Lots of dressings, and she'll be quite sore. My guy put up a paracetomol drip and injected local aneasthetic into the surgery sites to minimize the pain so that she was comfortable when she woke up, and could have a good sleep to get over it. It was brilliant, and it wasn't until she woke up that night (she went down at 08.30) after an afternoon sleep that she started to get uncomfortable. It takes 2 or 3 days for it all to settle and most of the pain to go away. Once they get used to the feeling, they do seem to adapt very quickly. There was a little boy on the ward who had the same op, and he didn't even notice it!! He was non verbal too and had many other issues. He was having 100,s of drop attacks every day, and had to wear a helmet permanently, and had one of those rubber harnesses so his mum could hold onto him and help break his fall. If she wasn't holding him, he was in a wheelchair. He is much better too, and it has had a profound effect on his drops.It will be tested in theatre, they give it a burst to test the settings, and so you may well find that you see a difference immediately from that burst, but of course you may not!! Frustrating isn't it?! It doesn't hurt at all when it's turned on. Not even slightly. The only thing they feel is a tickling. It does affect the voice a little bit, once it was turned up, her voice started to be a bit wobbly, and kind of trilly, when it pulsed. Every time they turn it up, she has a cough, her voice trills a bit more, and she can feel the tickle. She has it done on a Friday, and by Monday, she's stopped coughing, the tickle has gone, and she only trills when she's tired. When you use the magnet, it gives a much stronger pulse, so all the effects are felt more keenly, but because you use it for a seizure, they don't notice anyway. Too much else going on elsewhere lol. They keep turning it up every 4 weeks, and it's all done by a hand held computer, which is held over the implant, through clothes, so no undressing, then they tap a PDA, and up it goes. Done in seconds. If she has any problems, they can turn down some settings, turn up others, they just tailor it to the individual child.Please ask anything you need, I so wish I had had somebody to ask before my little girl had it done, so I really don't mind in the slightest.Good luck with it, don't be too nervous, it really isn't as bad as it feels, and once it's over and she's home, it's just a case of keeping everything nice and clean so it heals beautifully. Oh yes, and the scar on her neck isn't even visible now, in the space of 6 months.  The one under her arm is still red and you can see it, but it doesn't bother her at all, and will just fade eventually tool.Take care, and good luck!!

It can be a part of temporal lobe epilepsy. If lamictal is not able to control this, then some other drug can be tried in combination. If you have headaches, then this can be aura of migraine. It can also be a early sign of schizophrenia. It can also be due to a problem in olfactory receptor mechanism. This could be due to a smell getting trapped by nasal polyps or tumors. Sinusitis with post nasal drip can cause both a phantom smell and nausea and this should be investigated first by an ENT.  A psychological examination may also help. Sometimes, such smells can be due to hormonal disturbance in pre-menopause, so take a gynecological consultation too.Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you.

Seizure (convulsions) activity means that electrical activity is initiated in the brain which results in convulsions. Repeated convulsions can cause hypoxemia (decreased oxygen) supply to the brain, hence they need to be controlled. An EEG (electroencephalogram) can help confirm this. You may dosage needs to be changed or you may need more than one medication to treat the seizures. Please consult your doctor for further management.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.","answer"

A normal EEG does not exclude epilepsy because between seizures the brainwave patterns could be normal. During an outpatient's standard EEG there may be no abnormal activity occurring in the brain, so several EEGs may be needed. Other ways in which the EEG is used to detect epileptic activity include sleep EEG, ambulatory EEG, or Video-telemetry. This is a test that uses a video camera linked to an EEG machine. The camera will visually record your movements and at the same time the EEG machine will record your brainwave pattern. Both the video and EEG are stored onto a computer that can be reviewed once the test is finished. Discuss this with your doctor for proper evaluation. Take care and regards.","answer"

I had a friend who had the same problem with the EEG being normal. Finally she went and her EEG was just at the cutoff. She started taking meds and shes much better.

My brother aswell father and grandfather aswell suffer with seizures, and mental illness. Its difficult even for me to understand which disease is affecting me at the time it happens all I know is that in mania I dont get exhausted afterwords or have short term memory loss from my episodes, in siezures I can tell the difference with the partial seizures because you learn to recognise the onset of the seizure, the myoclonic siezures I come to understand need to be encouraged almost but not all of the time or something triggers them, for instance extreme adrenaline change or physical activities sometimes depending on what it is can trigger those seizures for me anyhow. As for the bipolar disorder it is pretty much under control from my siezure medication, but when having mania and epilepsy sometimes its even difficult for me to recognise the difference between the two, all accept for the symptoms of the two, usually you dont gernerally know until after the incident occurs do you know which episode from which disorder had ocurred at the time.When being born with both in the family you learn to recognise which is which over time, but it takes knowing your body, and understanding the symptoms and affects or reactions of both disorders, hope this helps.","answer"

I saw her eyes open and fixated upwards, one arm and one leg was jerking and she had drool and a little bit of vomit all along her mouth and the bed. I called 911 and they put in an iv and gave her valium. They stopped the seizure but it lasted 30 minutes. They took her to the ER via ambulance and her life hasn't been the same since. Like your little one, she was put on Keppra (200mg daily). She used to sleep and not get up all night but after the seizure, she hasn't slept the night since. She's totally cranky and always whining or crying. Prior to the ""BIG"" seizure i only noticed her jerking movements once in a while when she was newborn to about 8 months. Nothing big, in fact, i didn't know that those could be possible seizures. The ""BIG"" one took us by surprise.

So glad you posted your note. It is awesome to have someone else with a like sitaution to talk to. We have an almost twenty four month old buy. He has been having seizures since he was just a little baby. We first noted them at about six months old. Took him to the dr then but the eg was normal so even though we had taken in vidoes of the seizures the dr was not willing to medicate until an actual finding showed on tests....Seizures continued for months until one day after having multiple seizures and calling the neuro office and being told that he would out grow it, I took him to his regular pediatrician....and just in time too I might add. As we walked in the door he had a tonic clonic seizure, stopped breathing and was immediately admitted to the hospital and started on phenobarbital..another eeg was done....NORMAL RESULTS AGAIN!!..No seizures during the eeg, so.......He was on the phenobarb for several months but it just turned a normally happy little fellow in to a grouchy man!! and his sleeping was just rediculous!! he had always slep but all of a sudden he was waking at night and...oh it was aweful....We were sent  way out of town to Indianapolis to see a neurologist there at the childrens hospital.

Some of that is true, but you have to find your own way, since every single person has different feelings about their seizures. I started having them at 8 years old, and the first medications that they put me on turned me into a relative Zombie. Epilim made me fall asleep all the time, Phenabarbitone turns someone into a person who feels fatigue most of the time. The only perople who would recommend these would have been people who had never actually taken them. Seeing someone you love suffer symptoms of seizures, or, side effects of them is bad enough, but going through even one seizure is devastating, exhausting, and humiliating. At the time you tell everyone you are o.k. but just feel like a circus freak. I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy. The only tablet that did anything great was Lamotrigine - it revolutionised the amount of energy I had, and finally, I didn't have to suffer feeling ashamed in front of strangers.Please dont think every group home is so bad. I work in one and I am now a Registered Manager. Most places treat people with respect and care for them genuinely. Dont judge them all based on a few. But recently Keppra was added to my own medication, and I have not suffered any seizures since then. I cant explain to someone who has not suffered even one, but although I have mood swings, snap at people, and behave irratically, anything that can take seizures away will be considered. If I thought they would come back if I gave up medication, I would make a deal with the devil to take them away again. Suffering seizures is a nightmare. I have found taking a tablet called Ex-Stress, and taking vitamin B12 helps a lot. Also, just because someone has epilepsy doesnt make them less intelligent. I have 4 grade A 'A' Levels, 3 years at University, and level 5 professional qualifications. There are professors with it, and Mozart had it badly. Send love to your son, and I hope his life improves. God bless you.","answer"

You could also get a little tent or enclosed area for him to go when he gets overwhelmed. It does not sound like he is having a seizure, although some children with autism do suffer from seizure disorder. We also got our DD a service dog who helps calm her when she is upset.

Most seizures last from 30 seconds to 2 minutes and do not cause lasting harm. However, it is a medical emergency if seizures last longer than 5 minutes or if a person has many seizures and does not wake up between them. Seizures can have many causes, including medicines, high fevers, head injuries and certain diseases. Lidocaine can cause muscle twitching, convulsions, numbness of tongue or hypotension.  You can view this at this link: http://www.mims.com/Page.aspx?menuid=mng&name=Abbott+Lidocaine+inj&h=anaesthetics,local,generalThere are other triggers for seizures that must be identified such as alcohol or drug intake, sleep deprivation or hormonal fluctuations. I hope this site is helpful:http://www.epilepsyfoundation.org/about/types/triggers/livingtrigger.cfmIt’s also important to visit your doctor if this seizure occurs again or if your headache doesn’t respond to medications or if it’s getting worse for proper evaluation and management.I hope this helps. Take care and please do update us.","answer"

I have a mild disability and I think I suffer from slight depression because I dont do a lot on my days off college. I lack motivation to do work etc and will just watch tv and go on fb. I have no job and sometimes feel useless. I hate my legs so wont show them to anyone but know I think I will have to face that fear and go to the doctor. So when I had a seizure during my sleep I never did anything about it. I was scared, I dont like talking to people and I hate the idea of hospitals cos i hate myself so dont like the idea of having someone prod me. I had my first one over a year ago in my sleep and i was aware I was moving uncontrollably. I thought it was an earth quake at first and could see flashing lights/patterns in my mind. I thought at first that it could be because of excess computer playing games (World of warcraft). I carried on learning to drive and passed my driving test but because of my confidence issues I rarely drive alone. and I was worried because I felt my independance would be taken away from me. I couldnt understand buses at the time. Probably I year or less later I had another one, probably due to extreme tiredness from doing work experience all day. Now probably about 5 or  months later I am having problems with my eyes, They roll and twitch (which could just be stress). I am going to tell the doctor but I'm worried about the fact I have been driving whist Ive had 2 seizures in my sleep. Will they do anything about it? I know you can loose your driving licence but I am scared I will have to pay a fine or worse. I do not know the cause of these siezures, it could be damage caused by me falling off a horse but i do not know the exact time of either the fall or the siezure. I could have just developed it because of my cerebral palsy. I am worried about what my parents will think, because I will have to explain all my problems they are so ignorant about :S","question"

Basically I would look at something, say a tree, and when I looked away, I would still see the tree.. As my vision began to jump around, I began shaking.. I lost contentiousness and collapsed.. The attack lasted a few minutes.When I woke up, my memory was gone and it took around 5 minutes to return..This is the second time this has happened to me.. The last was two years ago over in England.. However the vision jumping thing has happened on a number of different occasions without resulting into a full blown seizure. The only thing I can think that links the two attack is lack of sleep.. I have been to the hospital and am on a waiting list for a specialist in this area.. The only other symptom was my blood sugar level was very low, around 2.6.My question is, what should I be doing in the mean time?? Are these common signs of epilepsy?? Could lack of sleep cause this?? Any information or advice would be greatly appreciated.. Thank you","question"

My dad recently had a wisdom tooth removed (I believe just the bottom). I'm not really sure about what really happened but he came home and his jaw was still hurting. Come to find out it was an infection, not sure what type, and so went back for that. Okay, so time had passed (not certain about a time line...not a long period of time though, within like 3 months maybe) and he still was telling us his jaw was hurting. You could even here it pop and it was definitely bothering him. It seems like he really hasn't been himself after that. So, jaw was popping a lot during this past week and the morning off his seizure. No one was around him when he had it, definitely seizure-like symptons; such as stiff muscles, biting of  the tounge (really bad), he couldn't open his eyes afterwards, confusion, speech wasn't clear, ect. Now, this was his first seizure as well! Nothing like this had ever happend before with him. No major health problems to list, besides his heart racing at times. A real scare to all of my family. We still have no answer as to why it happend nor if it may be linked to something. It is now Monday October 5(still in hospital) seizure took place on Thursday, October 1. While he was here he went into emergency surgery to remove his appendix (didn't rupture). Maybe just coincidental that that showed up when doing test and such. As of right now his jaw still hurts him; apparently rather sharp pains. Also you can here it pop. Any comments?","answer"

If I have another similar or longer I may be in trouble.  I just had another on 1/24/2010, but luckily it was shorter.I do not know if her MRI showed and her EEG were always normal, but if she has not had them,  I would think that she needs both.  Some seizure patients have totally normal EEGs except of course when they are having seizures.  I am one of them.  Has she had a blood level of the Dilantin to make sure it is not too high?","answer"

I wasz on the phone with 911 the first seizure cause it had lasted so long I have seen at least 8 seizures in my life and my boyfriends was not like any I have ever seen I had had to leave my boyfriend to let the first responders in and when i came back up he was boxing the air then tried to get up but was to wobbly to get up the hopelessness in his eye was so sad. He then grabbed the pillow i used to put under his head and started thrusting it the first responder had to ask him to stop during this whole time he did into say a word then then took him the the er. they ran a cat scan and blood work which all came back clear my boyfriend had a terrible head ace on his forehead like pressure. they gave him a tylanal . And sent use home alll my boyfriend wanted to do was go back to sleep cause his head was hurting so bad 3 hours later he sat up in bed and I starting asking him questions he should now and got no response so I helped him off the bed and onto the floor he then started poking me and saying 123456 and then started looking threw bags and then I continued to ask him questions he then said my name so i was re leaved this episode/ seizure lasted 2-3 min and his body was hot and sweaty so I called the er and they told me to come back so I got him dressed and ran him back they then did urine testing and a spinal tap which came back okay they are continuing to look at the fluid as time goes on they decided to keep use over night and ran a MRA and eeg the eeg found ab normal brain waves in the front left temple and they tried keppra 500 2 times a day but my boyfriend was having to many side affected so then they put him on zonisamide 100mg 2 at night he started with 1 at night for 3 days then uped it to 2. I just don't think that it was just seizures cause the way he acted during the first seizure he has not family history of seizures. If you have any suggestions on what we may be facing would be greatly appreciated. And when they sent use home they said he was non epileptic. And his blood work and urine all came back clear.

How are you? Do you have your MRI results already? Partial seizures happen where the electrical disturbance is limited to a specific area  of the brain. Partial seizures are subdivided into simple partial seizure (in which consciousness is retained); and  complex partial seizure (in which consciousness is impaired or lost). Virtually any movement, sensory, or emotional symptom can occur as part of a partial seizure, including complex visual or auditory hallucinations.

Based on the information shared by you it could be possible that your baby has suffered from shoulder dystocia during forceps delivery .Dystocia usually happens when the head comes out of the vagina but the shoulders become stuck. The infant can have broken bones or dislocation of the shoulders when being withdrawn. This can lead to inability to lift hands. Other possibilities are brachial plexus injuries leading to decreased movements in the hand. These are only few possibilities. For confirming the exact cause consult a Pediatrician at the earliest. Depending on the probable diagnosis he may refer your child to an advanced Pediatric care centre where a Pediatric neurologist and orthpaedician will be available.

Which is>>>>He started feeling a pain in about 2004. The pain is unbearable it is a shock which rises from upper right molars and follows through the right side of his head till backside of head.We contacted a neurosurgeon and he said it is two veins which touch each-other causing this terrible shock pain. He said the solution was an operation in which he'd cut the veins which are causing disturbance; but also he said it is not guaranteed that the pain will never arise again also there could come some other problem too like paralysis of some body-parts.Due to risk we didn't go for operation but we found a dentist who injected alcohol type injection in the molars (dad got his upper right molar removed a long time ago) of my dad and then dad didn't feel the pain for about one year. But after a year again he started feeling the same pain once again we went for the injection and again it worked for about one year and the same thing happened three to four times but about four to five months ago once again he started feeling the pain severe and once again we went for injection but it didn't work this time for a year and a week or two weeks ago once again my dad started feeling the same pain and once again we got him injected the same but this time the injection would work no more and pain won't go away.Now the only option we are left with is operation which is a too high risk, anything could happen.So what do we do now? the injections don't work now.Should we go for operation or is there another way?Please tell me with whatever good you can.Thanks in anticipation.","question"

They did a study showing that 90% of the people who take drugs for epilepsy become depressed and/or feel suicidal vs. those who were taking the placebo. The drugs are suppressing certain neurotransmitters in the brain to control the epilepsy that would make the patient an otherwise happy/happier  person.  Doctors don't like to inform patients of this for fear of them not taking these drugs to control their epilepsy. Finding this info out after all these years makes me feel a  bit happier knowing that the depression is chemically induced and not just happening to me without any reason.  Hope this helps him cope better knowing this.  Aside from that, i wouldn't treat him any different than someone you know who has high blood pressure.  Nobody likes feeling condescended to even if they do have a brain injury.  Treat him with the respect you'd give to anyone else.

The various defects which may occur are growth delay, limb abnormalities, facial defects; mental retardation etc. Inform your gynecologist about your delayed periods. Take up urine pregnancy test. If you are pregnant your doctor may gradually decrease the dose and stop it and may prescribe an alternative anti seizure medicine which is safe during pregnancy. Sudden withdrawal of antiseizure medication may precipitate seizures in a pregnant woman which can be dangerous for the fetus. Medicines are prescribed during pregnancy only if the benefits outweigh the risks. Your doctor may prescribe you high dose folic acid 4 mg to prevent spinal cord deformities.

When we are stressed the brain and the nervous system activity increases. This leads to increased brain’s electrical activity which increases the firing of the neurons and triggers a seizure in someone who is prone for seizures. Stress can indirectly also affect patients with seizure. It causes an increase in cortisol levels which influences seizure activity. Have you been investigated for your seizures? What medicines have you been taking? If you have been taking antiepileptic regularly then seizures should be controlled. You need to discuss with your neurologist if any dose adjustments of your antiepileptic drug needs to be done or any alternative drug needs to be taken. Hope it helps. Take care and good luck!","answer"

His platelets were very very high at that time....now its almost normal. My poor baby has been thru so much, being pricked and poked. I have 2 questions in particular that have me concerned and I don't know if this is the right place to post. hoping someone can point me in the right direction or has some sort of idea and can help me figure this out.My son will look up.......like he's thinking...sometimes he does it when he's eating and other times when I ask a question or when he's curious about something... sometimes he does it with ""MMMM"" and then looks up. but when I say he looks up.......its a little scary he really looks up, it doesn't look like a normal maneurism. Secondly, in the hospital he wanted to ""GO, GO GO GO GO GO GO"" pointing to outside......and we would of course comfort him it broke my heart, of course he didn't want to be there........but now its become an everyday occurence, when he wants me to get up He says ""Up up up up up up up"" over and over and over and whining turns to crying.........he does it when he wants to go outside or when I take his socks off ""Socks socks socks socks socks"" because he wants his socks back on or his shirt or whatever it is. If he wants to color with a green marker and im busy doing something but he wants that marker now ....""Green green green green green."" crying saying it over repeatedly........................I think you catch my drift.He gets extremely upset and it could be as simple as waiting for something he wants right that second, I've tried distracting up, cooling him down, telling him it;s okay, telling him to wait..being firmed, I've even yelled and nothing seems to work its like when his mind is on something thats it and he doesn't calm down............he has these melt downs almost everyday, I feel like I'm losing control. Part of me says it';s just him trying to manipulate and being almost 2 he's at that age where kids get tantrums, but a part of me feels like something is really not right..........I know there's more, just cant think at the moment!!

Made a follow up appointment for June 21 I am suppose to go that day they are doing an mri and I am to take the disk from the mri directlt to his office.  So he can plop it in the computer and review it right in front of me.  Im so upset my family Dr didnt do anything sooner and didnt at least call the neuro and ask if he would accept the Mri from here.  I am 43 years old my sister started havin her seizures when she was a teenager and continued to have them up until she was found dead at the age of 33.  Apparently she had decided to stop taking her medicine.  The first 6 weeks of waiting were hell on my nerves.  I realize an MRI can pick up so much more than a ct scan.  So now I have another month of the same worrying about what they are going to find that has caused this.  My worst fear is a tumor of some sort.  The neuro started me on lamitcal so I dont know if thats making me any moodier or what.  I am considering switching family drs because my dr was careless and didnt seem to really care one way or the other.  Not to mention the fact he told me I could go ahead and drive every time it happened.  This last time I was so scared I told him I couldnt drive til this was figured out.  To me he didnt only owe me to take precautions but to the general public of which had I had another episode driving I could have killed.  Anyone have any thoughts on this or am I just making a mountain out of a mole hill?","question"

I again started taking it in August & took it 5 months straight, & actully had increased its dosage to 60mg early December. I ran out on the 21st & stopes taking anymore until January 3rd, the day we came back from Christmas break. I also wanna point out i starting smoking weed(Yes i know it's not good for you, i quit 4 weeks ago) in mid October occasionally every other weekend. Then in November i had smoked some synthetic weed a little more than a hand full of times, then it got to a point where i was smoking weed every other day if not every day. Then when winter break started, i bought a pipe & had the chance to smoke by myself. I smoked alot during the break & when school started i didnt let up. I would smoke before school for every other day in January. I did for 2 weeks straight at the end of January. I was making moderate to good grades so i didnt think it was necessary to stop. That's when my first SYMPTOMS arouse. I would be in 5th period & still kinda feel the high of the weed but not really.

So everytime I sat in that class I didn't wanna make any stupid movements or face so I usually just kept my head up with my hands & tried to pay attention. But what got weird was when I'd be listing to the teacher, I'd look around the class but for some reason my eyes would have such jearky movements when i moved them. I remember it got to a point where i was in a trance & couldnt move them or my body for a couple second. The weirdness in me was showing more & more everyday. My speached was slowing down. I was mixing up words in my sentences. My short term memory was the worst it ever had been. & i was even pausing in the middle of sentences because of forgetting the next word i was gonna say. All of this was really hurting my self-asteem & attitude towards every one else. (lemme let you know that i was going on & of the vyvanse because of how bad the downfall was) (right before i was diagnosed with my next issue, i was diagnosed with walking pneumonia which was treated for a week with antibiotics & went away)Then in early February everything got worse when people began to say that i ""smelled"". for 2 weeks people were snickering, telling rumors, & making fun of me right in my face. It got to a point where i couldn't even be in class without only facing the direction towards my desk because of all the anxiety combined with my mental/nero issues. Iv been able to control my anxiety my whole life but my symptoms made it unberible to be at school. I finally went to my pediatrician & he check out my ""lower back area"" & discovered that i had a perianal fistual/abscess. He said I'd probably have to get it removed surgically but gave me antibiotics to treat it & said it'd be normal if it went away but it would eventually come back. After 2 weeks of anti biotics it went away after getting it checked out. That even mayed me miss more of school because when i came back in early march i was being treated even worse. Even being mocked by my own friends. I couldn't take it anymore. It got to a point where i couldn't ignore it no matter how hard i tried. My eyes were constantly watering. I wanted to burst out & yell ,& cry. I had to tell my dad on numerous occasions to pick me up from school. (at this point i stopped vyvanse & weed completely) Then i decided in mid march that i couldn't remain living my life at that school. I stayed home for the next 2 weeks as my dad was trying to get me transfers to another school. While being at home, having no friends or life, depression set in. & everything got 10 times worse.All i did was eat & sleep. I started to notice more twitching & every part of my body mostly when laying down. Legs, arms, even face sometimes. My knees especially tingle & feel numb& twitch everytime I lay on them or have a blanket over em. I started getting migranes (especially in my left eye that would go over my head down to the the back of my head on the left side. My eyes constantly seemed to be more blurry. My right eye gets darker/blurry in very dim light. (really my eyes hadn't looked normal since December. I noticed More vessels were appearing & the pink cavity inside your eye next to your nose was getting bigger.) I noticed my lower forhead/browbown was getting swollen/bigger & so was the bones on the side of the face next to the ear. I had so much pressure in my lower head & in my temples (which looked like they were sunken) I also noticed the bones on top of my shoulders were popping out more. & so was the collar bone. & I also noticed my shins felt like they were loosing bone density. But my biggest issue is that the weird eye movement I had back in January has evolved into a twitch im getting in my head & limbs. Like lets say il think about getting up to do something really urgent like get out of bed, my should will actully jerk up as if I was going to. Now im having these uncontrolled jerks when doing the most easiest things. Like il be laying down on my back using my phone, & il adjust my head but il overshoot it & my head will twitch back. It got to a point where it felt like i was lossing my motor skill & couldnt tottaly control myself. I haven't felt at ease & normal in a long time..I explained all my symptoms to my pediatrician & he was more focused on my anxiety so he prescribed me sertaline & set me up with a sycyatrist because me & my mom had got into an argument in the waiting room. After i took half a 50mg of sertaline the next day, i didnt feel a y different. Coming down did feel quite weird. At night my jerky movements got worse. I skipped the next day to take them. Then took them the day after that, it was the same. The day after that i didn't take it again but i woke up with no headache or bad feelings. I felt like it might be a good day, espiclly since my twitches wernt bothering me as much since i was kinda getting used to them. But aa i sat in a chair playing video games, i notcied how i couldnt atay focused on my tv. It was like i was so bored i was looking passed the tv, but i couldnt concentrate no matter how hard i tried. My pulse started getting fasteras so was my breathing & i felt light headed & dizzy. Then i felt like it was a dream. I couldnt move my limbs exactly how i wanted to & it felt like i was gonna black out. Felt like i had major brain fog. Idk why i got this way. It wasnt like my own anxiety provoked it. It eventully went away 15 mins later after having my mom helped me with my breathing. After that i felt extremly tired. I then saw the sycyatrist the next day with my dad & explained that i really didn't need a therepy, i needed a neurologist. I explained all my symptoms & told her about the incident & she tottaly agreed that I needed a neurologist because I could've had a seizure.I am now waiting for my next appoint with my peditrician so he can refer mw to whatever doctors I need to see. I hadden gotten extensive lab/blood work done back in late February that confirmed that I looked healthy. He also saw I tested positive for thc. Last time he talked to me he said I should be taking the sertaline in the mornings 30 mins before I take my 60 mg vyvanse. I did that for the first time today & at the high of my medicine I felt great. But now that im coming down my body cannot stop shivering, im having more intinse musle/motore twitches, & my speech has slowed down & im very forgetfull of words I need to say. If there's anyone out there who has any knowledge of what might be going on please please help. Im very scared. Its so hard to go out in public this way. I just want my life back..","question"

I have had a cyst in  my frontal lobe since I was 5 yrs old. The doctors mentioned that the cyst was dead due to excess of calcium. At age 5 I had a seizure but nothing was done about it. At  age 13 I had two more seizures and thats when doctors put me on Tegretol 200mg. An MRI was taken at age 5 and at age 13, the size of the cyst remained the same. The seizures only occur while I am asleep. As of now the Tegretol has worked but pretty soon I wont have insurance to cover the medicine. Previously like a few weeks ago I took Tegretol 2x day (morning and night). I talked to my neurologist about this and she recommended I have an EEG (which came out to be normal). So she told me to take Tegretol once a day. As of now I feel fine but do you think I will have seizures once I completely stop taking the medication. Its been almost a decade since I havent had any. Basically my questions are:1. What is the probability of having a seizure after I stop with the medication?2. Do you believe surgery is necessary to remove the cyst or should I just live with it?","question"

It’s true, stopping your medications could lead to more seizure. You could ask your doctor what other medications you can use. It’s good that your EEG result was normal. You should also know about the triggers that could cause seizure such as infection, drugs, lack of sleep or hormones. : Here’s a link for the triggers: http://www.epilepsy.org.uk/info/triggers.html	What kind of cyst do you have?  Do you have a recent MRI? Would you know if the size of the cyst has increased? There are specific types of cysts. They are named for the type of tissue from which they arise and for their contents. The most common cysts found in the brain are arachnoid, colloid, dermoid, epidermoid, and pineal cysts. Treatment for an arachnoid cyst may be “watchful waiting,” or it may be surgery. If the cyst is small and is not causing problems, just leave it as it is. It is important to keep your appointments for follow-up scans on a regular basis, as these cysts may slowly continue to enlarge. If the cyst is causing symptoms or is located in a part of the brain where continued growth would cause a problem, your doctor may suggest surgery to remove the cyst. The usual procedure is to drain and attempt to remove the entire cyst, including its outermost lining.  You can learn more about this through this link: 	http://www.abta.org/sitefiles/sitePages/4F77F57A14D6EBBE5C3FBC447B78FD57.pdfI hope this helps.

However, your son is also at the right age for epilepsy to show up. Make an appointment at a pediatric neurologist near where you live to make sure nothing more serious is going on. They're going to want to run various tests to see if anything seems to be wrong, and they may try to induce another seizure under a controlled enviroment. The good part is that your son is very young, and that means that he could outgrow the problem either on his own or with the help of medical intervention. Don't be afraid. These things are very treatable thanks to modern medicine. I hope all goes well for you and your son. I pray for you and wish you the best! ~ Em","answer"

He is a regular marijuana smoker and has poor health habits such as his diet. Sometimes when he smokes weed he gets warm and needs to lie down next to a fan and relax for a minute. This night was different; after a few seconds of half laying down half sitting up, he falls backwards and begins to go into what would be described as a grand mal seizure. I have to say that I was pretty terrified. He snapped out of it within about 30 seconds to a minute. My father is an emergency room doctor and a physician; I disregarded my friend and asked my father what he thought, to which he said that he needs to get it checked out. My friend has never had a seizure before this and he said he  felt absolutely fine afterwards and he felt as if I had woken him up from a dream. He doesn't believe that he  needs to be checked out.

I could hear/see them but couldn't move or speak.  After 3 days in the hospital, the EEG, EKG and a CATscan came out normal.  They put me on 1000mg of Keppra after having two other ""mild"" seizures.  They diagnosed me with complex partial seizures.Next day out of the hospital, I blacked out while walking.  The day after that, I had a ""spell"" where I couldn't move my legs.  I ended up in the hospital again the next day with ""Breakthrough seizures.""  They increased my dosage to 2000 mg of Keppra and the EEG came out normal.Few days after that, I ended up back in the hospital because I wasn't able to respond, or move my arms and legs.  They increased my dosage to 2500 mg of Keppra.I've done better since I've been on 2500mg of Keppra and am waiting for a brain MRI, day study, sleep study and a 48 hr EEG.  But I have noticed if I don't eat, I start limping, my right foot goes inward, I start twitching and it is hard to speak.  I am unsure if it is just low blood sugar because the same thing happened before my first seizure and when I went to the hospital, they said my sugar level was good to go.Any advice?","question"

I am in and out of conciousness during it and generally it lasts about 1-3min. Afterwards I am lethargic, sometimes I have trouble speaking and my thoughts are muddled.This all reached its peak around a year ago and I had to go on disability. I also developed migraines around the same time. MRI showed a pineal cyst, bloodworkup only showed elevated iron, and sodium levels. I had several EEG tests(1hr, 24hr, 3dayVEEG and admission to an EMU at University of Penn for what I thought was supposed to be an extended stay for evaluation but only lasted 1 day), they showed temporal slowing. So I was told I had psychogenic seizures, and to get counseling. I had been on dilantin (which decreased my seizures), during the last EEG but they took me off when they changed the diagnosis. Since I've been off, I've had seizures everyday. I have dizziness, imbalance, weakness in my exremities, poor concentration, and memory which has been consistant prior to and throughout these trying times. I am at my wits end! Not saying that I haven't listened to the doctors I have been seeing and taken their advice to see a therapist. I just wanted to know what you all thought.Thanks!!","question"

These medications rarely stop the seizures completely but reduce the frequency and severity of them.  I hope this helps, my prayers are with you and your son.","answer"

When I was young, around 9-10 I had epilepsy. I would have what they call ""absence seizures"". What would happen is I would be doing something, whether it's playing a board game, eating food, or talking to someone, and I would pause for 10 seconds and totally blank out. Then I would just continue doing what I was doing like normal, as if there was no pause.This is how it all started. I went to my friend's cabin one night. Now that day, I did not have very much to eat or drink. When I got out to the cabin, I drank 4 shots of rum and 6 regular beers. I was not very drunk, just slightly buzzed. I also had a full Cuban cigar. It was my first time smoking anything. So that night I went to bed, like normal. I got up early that morning (only got 5 hours of sleep) and tried drinking some tea. I wasn't able to keep it down, threw it up. So I tried to eat some chips and Pepsi, that helped a little. I made my way home no problem. My parents bought me a breakfast sandwich hoping that the grease would settle my stomach.Anyways, me my father and my brother went out of town to look at a car for my brother. On the way out, say 30 minutes I blacked out. My father told me my eyes rolled up in my head and I started compulsing and foaming from the mouth. I was throwing up all over the place and going in and out of consciousness. Eventually they brought me home. I could barely hold my own body up and make my way into the house, so my parents helped me in and put me to bed.They said I slept for about 5 hours. When I got up, I was feeling back to normal.My question: Is this something to worry about? Will I be having seizures in the future? Should I go and tell the doctor about this?TIA","question"

Took many tests with negatives coming back and now am seeing little spots the size of the eraser at a end of a pencil, note I only took one pill that night on Dec. 30 that was 25 mg, its odd my period wouldn't be here if I ovulated before I took the medicine, would the egg be fertilize and could of implanted or can it still not come out cause the medicine is causing my period to stop?

The 26th, they did a urine test for pregnancy but just had my period end the wed before so it wouldn't be possible, they probably were checking to make sure my period was my period. The reason I went to the E.R. was cause I had a seizure right after I was waiting to throw up at the toilet, I now know it was probably due to the low potassium, which was slightly off by .2 and the minimum is 3.5, the missed period couldd be the potassium to but even the doctors weren't worried said the level wasn't that low and that just up my potassium intake naturally. Ever since been drinking more orange juice, fruit, eating good, etc...... went to see doc and got my meds the 30th of Dec and took one tablet 25mg the same day which is when my egg was waiting.

I have a brief story on the beginning of the seizure page here. Anyways, your daughter should not be drinking alcohol, period! People who suffer from seizures should be eating healthy, adequately and getting adequate rest, 7-8 hrs minimum. Alcohol is a no-no and water is a yes yes. Usually, they'd say, don't give a person who just had a seizure anything to eat or drink(especially drink), but after all my episodes in the past, when I drank water, immediately I became more aware and had more energy. Your daughter needs to take care of herself and keep herself hydrated. Epilepsy itself isn't as dangerous as say asthma in some cases, but when you fall and injure yourself(I broke my jaw and got concussions), start experiencing slurred speech, forgetfulness to the point that during a sentence you completely forgot what you were going to say....all the time, it's not fun. It's a difficult thing to deal with and few people understand. Epilepsy have killed people before; if you fall and seriously injure yourself, or experience a seizure while driving, swimming...not good, especially if others are in th car. I'm still very afraid to drive, even though I haven't had a seizure for some time; it's always in the back of my mind. And the medications don't help ease the pain. Sometimes, you have to try so much to find the right one or combination for you, and sometimes you never find it, and other times, the medication that seems to work, may need to change as time progresses. I was on both Trileptal and dilantin, and both of them made me sick, and drowsy.To Nena351, I hope everything works out for your mom. I am of the belief now that epilepsy is not fully understood. Science have standards as what constitutes epilepsy, but so many people have epileptic symtoms and test results are normal. My EEG showed absolutely nothing that was abnormal, according to them, I was fine. But, if I was fine, they wouldn't have had me on meds and monitored me; something was wrong with me. Get a 2nd and 3rd opinion if you have to, try other meds under the watch of a doc of course. Epilepsy can really hinder your life, trust me I know and your mom is in my thoughts and prayers.","answer"

From what I have read, it does indeed sound like your daughter has seizures. Something that I wonder about is Calcium and Magnesium work on the energy production in our brain, when I take them at night at times I feel very relaxed. I do not know if this would be helpful with seizures, but you might look and see if anyone has done studies on this. Before you try this with her, take this combonation yourself and see what I mean. I think our food is so milled that we are lacking in some of the minerals our bodies need. This is just a theory on my part. You might add this to her diet but I would also highly suggest that you have her on some medications for awhile, you do not what her to fall and hurt herself.  One other note, I ran into a girl ( actually at the vets) who has seizures and she said she has a low thyroid ( just like my dog) and takes that medication along with anti-seizure med's. One other note, if my dog is around too much activity it can make him go into a seizure, but one traite I have noticed is his head will be hot the day prior an attack. I wish you well.","answer"

I have had epilepsy since I was 2 yrs. old. I have gran mal seizures if not treated. I had many as a child and seemed to be related to emotions. If I got hurt, excited, overwhelmed...I would have a seizure and it was always gran mal. This was many years ago and back then they would not diagnose me as having epilepsy because that would mean that I couldn't attend a regular public school. This was back in the 50's. I wasn't actually diagnosed until the 80's. Like your mother they put me on Dilantin. I had a lot of trouble on this drug. My balance was off. I was depressed and spacey. I felt weird and just didn't like the way I was feeling. I went to the Drs and he was simply studying me while on this medication. I told him of my symptoms. He then left the room, entered a room next door and began recording my symptoms on the medication. He didn't help me but expressed that I should just give it time. After that I got another Dr. he put me on Tegretol, that was in 1988. I haven't had any problems since. I'm sharing this with you because I want to encourage you to be your own advocate. You know how you feel. You know the rapour you have with your Dr. This drug may or may not be the right one for you. There are many out there now that treat Epilepsy. You are not bound to one drug.

She was involved in several work related accidents that have been covered by workers comp, which her employer is now claiming is exhausted. She is partially disabled as a result of these injuries and has endured what can only be described as a hostile work environment with it appearing that they are putting the final squeeze on her to get her out. This ongoing situation has added considerable stress to her life.Her description of the seizure like event and course of immediate action:""Last Thursday, 11/10, I suffered a seizure-like event and ended up in the ER. I was sleeping on the couch when it started off with a twitching on the left side of my mouth and progressed to either one or both of my arms flailing, screaming or moaning and throwing myself off the couch. John was upstairs at the time and found me with my head between where the sides of the couches meet and got me up off the floor and called 911. The EMTs were able to stabilize me fairly quickly and then transported me to the hospital. After blood and urine testing, an EKG, chest x-ray and CAT scan of my head, I was sent home with the recommendation to see a neurologist.Yesterday I saw the neurologist. While he did his exam, my reflexes were off the chart. He tested sites on both my arms and my legs and each time I basically jumped off the exam table. He indicated after both the physical exam and the interview that there is little chance that this is related to epilepsy, due to my age and health history. I am scheduled for an EEG on 12/07 and then a follow-up with the neurologist a few weeks later. (If there are any cancellations, the office will contact me prior to 12/07 to reschedule the EEG.) At this time, John and I believe that the stress of my current situation finally got to me and I had a MAJOR anxiety attack. I still have symptoms which occur when I am upset, most often an involuntary twitch or spasm of my left arm but nothing as severe as what happened last week.""Any advice, insight, feedback or information would be greatly appreciated.","answer"

Sudden-onset slurred speech is an important clinical sign that should be evaluated straight away to rule out stroke or similar life-threatening events.

(like dishwasher with garbage disposer).  I also feel like I have to work a lot harder in school than I used to.  In addition, I feel like solving higher level math problems are exceedingly difficult for me, even though as a child I was considered to be gifted in all areas, especially fast math calculations.Other odd things that have happened to me with in the past few years include the following:Often, when I lift my hands over my head to reach for something or do my hair, my arms will suddenly hurt, feel weak, and then I feel like I'm going to pass out.Sometimes, this is accompanied by fluttering and almost like a feeling like a bubble is in my chest.  There have been times where I could not breathe for a couple seconds.  It felt like I was choking, but from the chest.I have always had Raynaud's phenomenon in my feet and hands.Sometimes, its hard for me to recover from a chilly area.  I have turned blue in 70 degree weather and was shaking violently.  My fingernails also turned blue. When I was in middle school, an administrator saw me like this and demanded I go to the nurse because he thought I had a high fever, but my temperature was normal.  More recently, I turned blue and coworkers thought I wasn't getting enough oxygen but I got it tested and it was 100% saturated.Sometimes my hands will get very red, painful and swollen.  A more scary incident happened recently where my whole ARM got very very swollen and painful, feeling like it was going to explode.  My veins were bulging and my arm turned purple.Sometimes the slightest thing like carrying a normal sized purse will cut off circulation to my arm.I have had a couple episodes where my arms and legs felt extremely weak all of a sudden and I had to have someone help me walk.Medical History:As a newborn I had pneumonia and was hospitalized for a week.  At 2yrs I cracked my skull but it healed fine, no plating was needed.  I seem to always have an ear infection and often get respiratory infections.  I was diagnosed with exercise induced asthma at age 7.  I went through puberty at an early age, getting my period at age 9.  I have had a history of irregular periods and sometimes they have stopped altogether (for 6mos, needed to go on birth control/a pill to kick start it).  They are usually very painful and heavy.I know this is a lot of information, but I have been suffering with this a long time and want some answers...Thank you!","question"

These episodes are not brought on by anything in particular and can occur at any time, although I am photosensitive as bright flashes from cameras make my vision fade and disorientate me.

When I was younger I had brilliant memory could know something off by heart within seconds of reading it, nowadays my short term memory is getting worse sometimes even forgetting conversations seconds ago or what happened over the last day. I know that when i was younger balls of colour would fill my vision instead of getting the blackouts but as I got older they got worse. I do also get some minor twitches aswell that would make me spasm for just a second. Sometimes I can go a good period of time without getting any of these episodes but then other times I can get a load over a week or two.I would love to hear if you got any answers on this as I would love some information aswell","answer"

I asked her if she was okay and she said she was dizzy. She sat down on the bench and she looked at me and her eyes rolled back and she fell sideways. I grabbed her and took off her ball helmet and laid her down on the bench, her eyes were open and it looked like she was having a seizure so I tried to put her on her side but her lower legs were so stiff I couldnt move her. When she finally came through she looked very confused and she tried to sit up. I told her to stay down until she felt a little better. I put the cold water bottle on her head until she felt that she could sit up.  it all lasted about a min.  She was groggy for about 15 mins after.  I also noticed after that she peed her pants. She told me after that when she was holding the bat 10 min before it happened that her arms felt weak like she couldnt hole the bat. She didnt see stars nor could she hear me talking and she couldnt remember anything. I went to the hospital and they said it was a seizure but now I have to wait for a phone call to get her an EEg done.  What kind of seizure would this be?","question"

The way she felt before was the aura and the confusion after is called the post ictal phase but they shouldn't diagnose epilepsy after only one seizure. Many people have single seizures and go on to live the rest of their lives completely seizure free without medication. They only diagnosed me with epilepsy after three seizures. Bear in mind that, this being said, she may have a normal eeg and go on to have more seizures. An eeg only shows epileptic activity when some sort of seizure is taking place. I hope you never have to experience this again but if she is diagnosed with epilepsy, keep in mind that many of us live normal, happy lives. I'm loathe to generalise but many of the people who populate forums like this don't have good control of their epilepsy, which is why they're here: for support. Don't take their stories as an indication of the general epilepsy population. I have had control of my condition for 3 years. Other than a recent bout of seizures caused by inferior medication, i've been completely seizure free. All the best.","answer"

At first, I was having ""Black Outs"" for couple seconds, and then they increased in time a bit. After a year or so, The Black Outs Lead to seizures, foam coming out of my mouth, i would bite my tongue, etc... and i would be on them for about 2 to 3 mins. I met with a Neurologist in Utah, after the MRI's and EEG's being done he recommended that I should have a Surgery, that was 70% sure it was going to reduce my seizures, or not have any at all after. Well I decided to go through the 8 hour surgery, and a very expensive one. After the procedure, I was put on ""kepra', Within a Month I started having Seizures, Just like before, and i kept having them. I've done More MRI's everything seemed to be ok, the Neurologist stated that I should keep taking the meds and if no changes appear go through another Surgery... and hope for the best...I kept taking the meds, no changes. Having my origins from Europe, i started seeking help over there. I met with the Neurologist In Pristina Kosovo, who was highly recommended, Told him my story. He had me do an MRI and EEG, While the MRI looked normal, (besides the part of the brain missing due to the surgery), The EEG, Showed the possibilities of my Seizures.And By This Neurologist I was put on Tegretol CR 400 mg. Ever Since I've been taking them, I haven't had a Seizure during the day, But yet i started having them in my Sleep, nothing similar to the seizures i was having before, during the day. Now in my sleep, I start swallowing raise my right hand, open fist, i move my fingers, for about a min, after that i start talking just about anything, for about another minute or two... I've Contacted the Neurologist in Europe, he recommends that I keep taking the meds, because sooner or later they'll stop...But I was wondering if there's anybody out there, that maybe has a different answer for such a unusual activity.Your Time and Effort would be greatly appreciated... Thank You","question"

He's taking a drug to control it right now, and so far he hasn't had a seizure in almost 3 years.The drug he's on is weakened by alcohol ( if that's correct ) which when he drinks causes the medication to weaken and causing him to have a seizure.My question is, what can he do so he's able to have a few beers every now and then with his friends? I heard that he may be able to take twice his medication before having a couple beers, but I'm not sure. He hasn't had any alcohol since the first seizure, so me and my mother wanted to know if was even okay for him to have a drink.Thanks","question"

They are no big deal so don't worry about them. My seizures are a result of having a brain tumor. They told me I have complex partial seizures and focal motor seizures. I have pretty much all symptoms or problems that your doctor told that you can get plus a little more. Having no control over what your body will do at any given time is scary and I don't know if that will ever go away completely. I think you will just become less scared as time goes on. My family and friends know about my problems and are supportive of me 100%. When you feel scared talk to them, it does help. We even joke around about it that is why a lot of my friends call me flipper. I was in the Navy and cannot hold you being in the Army against you.  I was actually placed on social security by the time I was 29 because mine where not able to be controlled.

They happened whilst falling asleep and I woke up having bitten my tongue the first time. I was sent to neurology who wanted to be on the safe side and sent me for an EEG and an MRI. Both were normal, though they found slight abnormalities in my EEG, with slow waves in my temporal regions. They thought it was basically fine though. They are still investigating me for epilepsy and said if I had another episode, to let them know. A few nights ago, I sustained an injury and woke up with the bed covers strewn everywhere, acheing limbs, fingers bent into claws, exhaustion, etc. and have had a splitting headache yesterday and today.I'm seeing the neurologist anyway on the 30th August but everyone is concerned that I might have epilepsy, especially as I am now on no medication that is known to ever cause seizures.I've been on anticonvulsants in the past for psychiatric reasons, which stopped me having weird things at night, but I'm now not on them anymore. My question is this: I have had weird things at night all my life every now and then. I wake up and seem to stumble round the room in intense paranoia and fear for a few minutes then go back to bed, then wake up with the bed things strewn everywhere. I've been told it's not psychiatric (I think in psychiatry it's called sleep terror disorder) and I found out from the person who did my EEG that they might be seizures but they've never been investigated. Just wondering if anyone knows anything about this?  Oh the other thing is that when I was on Depakote, it completely cleared up these weird night experiences, then they started again once I came off it.Thanks.Filmore","question"

I can relate to you strongly because I had a tonic/clonic seizure last September they did a EEG and it was abnormal slightly and my MRI was fine. They put me on keppra 1000mgs 2 a day. Even before my first seizure I used to be very spaced out and dazed looking constantly and go figure that was a type of seizure (since theres different kinds). Also in my sleep if I sleep next to someone they tell me I seize out, they don't dare wake me cause it could only get more severe from then on, but I always happen to wake up that next morning with a headache and I'm achy in my back. Theres a lot of times as well where I will constantly have nights of tossing and turning, as well as a slight anxious/fear feeling as you described and when I wake up pillows/blankets all strewn everywhere. I would consider you taking depakote again and stay on it for at least 3 years until your seizure free, look more into what types of seizures you may have. I wish you the best!","answer"

A seizure is caused by a sudden burst of excess electrical activity in your brain, causing a temporary disruption in the normal functioning of your brain cells. Your brain is responsible for all the functions of your body, so what you experience during a seizure will depend on where in your brain the epileptic activity begins and how widely and rapidly it spreads. Because the brain controls our emotions and moods, it is not surprising that any disruption to normal brain functions can also cause depression. Studies suggest that people with damage to the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain are more prone to depression than those with damage to other parts of the brain.Sometimes the reason epilepsy develops is clear. It could be because of brain damage caused by a difficult birth; a severe blow to the head; a stroke which starves the brain of oxygen; or an infection of the brain such as meningitis. For most people there is no known cause for their epilepsy.Depression is a common experience for many people, but it is known to occur more often in people with epilepsy. Depression can sometimes be a side effect of medication such as some barbiturates and is often dose-related. Taking one or more other anti-epileptic drugs in combination with a barbiturate can also increase the risk of developing depression.

All turned out ""normal"". From Dec until now I am also having these wierd sensations which are hard to describe..please bear with me. It happens most frequently at night, or im already in bed, although on occasion they happen during the day if im very tired. I get what i feel is a lightning bolt sensation in my body. It seems to start from the chest. (cardiac problems ruled out).. from there I will either hear something that isnt there or percieve a smell that isnt there, like burning or skunk or something like that.. while thats happenning it always looks like the lights are flickering on and off very fast. Sometimes these last for 10 seconds... the longest being about a minute long.. Anyhow I know you cannot make a diagnosis, but does this sound a little like simple partials?

For years all of my tests kept coming back normal. I've had no other health issues. Check your dental work for a bad root canal.My dentist didn't even have a clue, but another doctor finally looked at this and saw the problem. In a bad root canal, you have no feeling, so it goes untreated. For about 10 years, mine had caused infection which went into my lymph gland and meningal system. Every few weeks due to just normal circulation, it would cause a swelling in my brain which would result in mild seizures. For years I didn't even consider them seizures because usually they were so mild that they resembled migraines. I even considered ""silent"" migraines because they were normally painless. Over the years, MRIs, CT scans, etc were all normal. Finally I had an ""episode"" at work where I was unresponsive for about 3 minutes, with only a slight shaking of my wrist. They had to send me to the ER, I had to be cleared with the DMV to drive - even though I had been driving without any problems for years. The good thing was that this trip to the ER resulted in an MRI right then and there where my brain was swollen at the time and the doctor saw it and told me about it. From there, I was referred to a very senior doctor who even teaches at the medical college. He instantly diagnosed me as epileptic and put me on a drug. (Another through the revolving door of his drugged patients.) He didn't know what to do with me when I had the most horrendous side effects so he wouldn't return my calls. Anyway, my other doctors (at the Center for Advanced Medicine, Encinitas, CA), saw that my root canal had gone bad and two weeks later I had it pulled. NO REOCCURENCE of these seizures. NO meds since the antibiotics that I took to take care of the infection. Dr. Kellas and Dr. Drucker will tell you that it isn't a matter of ""if"" but of ""when"" a root canal will go bad. People have wound up in wheelchairs due to complications of bad root canals causing infections that wreaked havoc in their bodies!  Check this out, and I hope you find what is ailing you. It's SO frustrating when the tests keep coming back ""normal"" but your body keeps reacting to something strange. I hope that you find whatever it is that's causing your symptoms. If you want to check out this clinic, (in Encinitas, in north San Diego), they look for the root causes of things. On KPRZ, you can hear them on their call in show on Saturdays, 9am -10am PST.

Keppra or levetiracetam is indicated for seizure and sometimes used to treat neuropathic pain. The exact mechanism in treating epilepsy is actually unknown but the drug is known to bind to a synaptic vesicle protein which is believed to impede nerve conduction across synapses. Diagnostic tests such as EEG may be normal especially if it was done after the seizure episode. It is important that you take your medications regularly and as prescribed. Missing a dose may lead to breakthrough seizures and increases the chance of getting an attack. Having an an attack does not necessarily mean you also have a brain tumor.Imaging studies such as Ct scan will help rule this out. Take care and best regards.","answer"

While this condition cannot be cured at present, for some people it does eventually go away. For many people with epilepsy, it is difficult to drive and participate in some recreational activities. Most women with epilepsy can become pregnant and can have a normal and healthy baby. However, it is important that regular follow-up with the attending physician and intake of medications ( Keppra ) is done. It is also important to know that two life-threatening conditions: status epilepticus and sudden unexplained death are risks for this condition. Support groups in your school, locality and even here in the net may greatly help. Take care always.","answer"

"Do I Have Photosensitive Epilepsy?","https://www.medhelp.org/posts/Epilepsy/Do-I-Have-Photosensitive-Epilepsy/show/1485010","Web123","2011-03-19T16:54:08-04:00","I gradually become disoriented, twitchy, nauseated, red-faced and very uncomfortable in the following scenarios: -using the computer at night-watching television at night-going to the movie theater-entering buildings with lots of fluorescent light (e.g. Walmart, Borders)It's easier for me to do these things in the daytime, but I still get sick if I'm exposed for too long. For example, If I'm feeling well and it's daytime, I can watch television for about one hour before I start to feel a little disoriented. Anything longer than that increases the disorientation exponentially, until I'm sitting there with no idea what I'm watching, unable to follow a basketball game or the plot line of a film. I also notice that my face turns red, particularly my upper cheeks, as though I have a sunburn. This process is sped up at nighttime. Generally, I can only watch television for about fifteen minutes at night before feeling disoriented. It's like I have a ""meter"" for how long I can withstand any of these scenarios. Once the meter runs out, I have some sort of seizure or intense, jerking reaction. The reaction has only happened a handful of times because I usually prevent myself from being stimulated to that extent. But when it does happen, I end up brain dead for about two days, kind of like a bruise or cut that must heal. At this point, just looking at a computer screen or television will trigger disorientation. Then, the meter refills, and I can slowly increase exposure, but never beyond a couple of hours at the most. I'm 26 years old, and this has been happening to me for about three years. Never had any problems whatsoever when I was younger. So far, the only way I feel better is if I remove all of the stimulants. Just one day of doing this makes me feel like a completely different person. The problem is that I'm in law school and I rely heavily on my computer for note-taking and assignments, so I usually feel disoriented throughout the day at varying intensities. Beyond this, it's obviously not normal to feel so disoriented and sick when watching television or surfing the web, otherwise no one would do it. I'm wondering if this is photosensitive epilepsy. It's also triggered in bookstores and museums, but I'm not sure if this is because of the lighting or the overabundance of visual stimulation, which makes me a bit skeptical of epilepsy. Here is the latest instance: my girlfriend and I went to Fernbank Museum in Atlanta, which has an enormous, naturally-lighted atrium. While in the atrium, I felt incredible. I was able to study all of the exhibits there without confusion or discomfort. I remarked to my girlfriend that I felt great and clear. Then, we went into an exhibit that was dark with electric lighting. I was incredibly disoriented within a minute of walking in. I was standing in front of a model of a large animal and was so confused that I couldn't clear my head enough to figure out what it was called until a lady behind me told her child to 'look at the giant turkey.' Not good. If you're still with me, thank you for reading. Please post any ideas or thoughts on what it could be. One final addition is that I suffer from dissociation and depersonalization, and this is enhanced whenever I'm doing one of the stimulating activities above. Thanks again.","question"

I didn't sleep all that well and woke up at 3pm, later Sunday i fell asleep at 8pm and woke up today at 7am. So i missed a lot of sleep and then slept a lot.My alarm for work went off today at 6:00am, i snoozed till 630am and jumped out of bed after a long sleep. I got in the shower, while in the shower i started to feel nauseous as if i was going to puke. I got out of the shower, dried off, put on some lotion; basic post shower routine. I went to the kitchen still feeling nauseous to get some water, then decided to hover over the toilet incase i puked. I never was able to puke so i went back to the kitchen for more water.After that it gets a lil fuzzy, I remember thinking to myself I am on the floor shaking this is not normal and got up.. Still completely out of it I made it all but 2 steps into the living room carpet and again I remember thinking to myself you are on the floor shaking what is wrong with you and got up. After getting up the second time, I was still groggy but i felt 10x better, the feeling of dizziness and wanting to puke was gone.. I could see in the kitchen that the table was moved about 3 feet against the wall, I am guessing i passed out on it? I have no idea.All i can think is that I had a seizure?

Is there a family history of seizure? Was there a previous trauma with the head? Differentiating a seizure from other conditions such as syncope/faint can be difficult. The most dramatic symptom is generalized convulsions. The child may undergo rhythmic jerking and muscle spasms, sometimes with difficulty breathing and rolling eyes. The child is often sleepy and confused after the seizure and does not remember the seizure afterward. Partial seizures usually affect only one group of muscles, which spasm and move convulsively. Children with this type of seizure may also behave strangely during the episode and may or may not remember the seizure itself after it ends.Have your daughter evaluated at the pediatrician's office. A wide variety of tests can be performed on a child who is thought to have seizures. This testing depends on the child's age and suspected type of seizures. It is recommended that  an electroencephalogram (EEG) and  brain imaging with CT scan or MRI scan in the work-up of those  presenting with a first apparently unprovoked seizure.

I'm sorry, this is going to be quite long...i'm really worried and I be it that it's my first time, I just wanted to give a little background! I apologize in advance if it's too longA little over 2 weeks ago I had a seizure @ home @ night. It was my first time... lucky my boyfriend was home and handled it actually pretty well. I saw an epilepsy specialist a few days later and he gave me an ambulatory EEG to wear for the night. Nothing out of the ordinary happened over night and I returned it the following day. I really was convinced this was a one time thing and everything would be fine.On Monday I went back for my results and I was told my EEG is abnormal and he diagnosed me with epilepsy. He has not prescribed me any medication, and i do not drive (well, I have a license but I don't have a car). I am do back in 8 weeks. He told me to take 250mg of magnesium a day and get a MRI. He also said we'll discus maybe medication then, but I've read the horrible side affects, and I'm already depressed and anxious, and I really don't want to take them if it's unnecessary. I've read a lot about the disease itself, but I wanted to just hear from others that also have epilepsy or are familiar with it and can share any advise with me.Even though the nero I saw is borderline genius he didn't answer a lot of the question I had. From reading on line it sounds to me like I had either tonic seizures or atonic seizure.(can you have both?) Basically, I got up from the chair and felt extremely dizzy to the point where my vision started being unfocused and I had to hold on the the table not to fall. I remember holding a something in both my hands. The next thing I know I'm on the chair, shaking and not being able to say anything or focus my vision on anything. I was so lucky my boyfriend was home and right next to me. He said I dropped whatever I was holding in my hands first and fell on the chair (bc the chair was right behind me), my head went to the right side almost instantly and my head and neck were jerking ""left and right back and forth"" (as per his description). My eyes were rolling in the back of my head. I don't quite remember it that way, but I was hearing him say my name and ask what's the matter, what's the matter? He said it lasted about 10-20 seconds. He snapped his fingers (i don't know if that's what made me come out of it or the seizure itself just ended, and I also don't remember him snapping his fingers, but he said I came back), but I was confused, and all I could say was ""what"" over and over again. He took me to the couch and I layed down, I kept touching my teeth, and like biting my lips, and I was very tiered. He said I was disoriented for about 10-15 minutes later. After that I felt perfectly fine, except very scared and anxious. Since then, we watched a movie and just got blueray, and there were lots of lights going on in the movie (I am # 4 was the movie) and that bothered my eyes so much I had to cover them! I get dizzy often when I get up, but I sit back down right away and it goes away. Sometimes I get blurry vision (like right now actually) but it also goes away. I need to add a few things about me (i'm sorry i'm rambling, i just want to get it all out there). I'm 31. I'm under tremendousness amount of stress and have been since last October. I've lost 40+ lbs since then (i am now about 137 lbs) bc of all the stress that's going on. I also have another neurological disorder, Pseudotumor cerebri, but have been off medication for about 2 yrs bc I'm feeling much better. I've had neumourus MRI's in the past and CTs bc of the PTC, last one in 10/09, and they all have been normal. My nero said this next MRI will probably come out abnormal bc of the new on set seizure. I went to a different neurologist then the one I see for PTC. Should I go back to him?For the ones who are ""experienced"" (for lack of better words) with this...any advise please...as into do u know when a seizure comes on? is there anything to prevented it? do you know what triggered your first seizure? certain things that trigger it for you? should I follow a certain diet? do i really need medication? I smoke and I socially drink (really socially, lately not even once a month). I also smoke pot now and then, but I was told that may help it. I sometimes take Xanax to help me sleep, but @ no other time during the day. The seizure happened about a week before my period. I am on no other medication.Thanking in advance for your answers and help! Again, I am sorry it's so long....","question"

I felt like I coundnt breath. It ended up that I stopped breathing and ended up in ICU. They tought I had a brain anuerysm so I was sent to UCLA for a femoral artery angiogram. While on the table they injected dyeinto the left side of my brain and I immediatly had a seizure. Only the right side was affected. Thedoctor told me I had a seizure disorder on the left side of my brain that causes the right side to shake. Since January I have had some sort of episode at least every week and a half. I notice that I will feel tingling in my lower legs and/or arms. Lately (the last 2 mon.) I have noticed that my right eye will start to twitch and sag before an episode. Over the last few months I have noticed that my episodes have changed to. Instead of a constnt shaking on the right side it is some shaking and a tensing of the muscles on the right side only. I usualy have a headache on the left side of my head before and after. I have also started to notice that lately before an episode it is like my brain is grinding to a hault. I get ""stuck."" For example I was cooking and I got stuck with a can in my hand. The muscles were so tensed I couldnt let go and my husband had o pry the can out of my hand. I had never experienced anything like this until I had my baby. My nuerologist thinks it is epilepsy. The other strange thing is these episodes of muscle contraction and seizing can last for over 30 minutes. I am awke during it, but I cant talk or express myself. I am usually stuck where ever it happens. I also have a hard time talking for about 10 to 15 minutes afterward. It is like my brain has to reboot. Does this sound like epilepsy????

Your son deserves the best medical care available.  All the best--if I can answer any other questions, don't hesitate to ask.","answer"

I am seeking a second opinion cause, my current GP is a ******* idiot (screwed up with my appointments, ducked/dodged me repeatedly, missed appointments, messed up appointments, not returning calls etc) and I do not trust leaving this in his hands alone especially with my bro's life in the balance.

Calling emergency services is of course the best thing to do when in doubt. You can also call the nurse help line at a hospital or your health insurance, if your insurance provides that service.Each person with a seizure disorder is different, so it's hard to give general recommendations about triggers. Approximately one-third of people with seizure disorders are photosensitive, so they should avoid flashing or strobing lights, particularly at 3 Hz. Stress, reduced sleep, illness, and other life events can trigger seizures, too. All this makes working with a physician to achieve good seizure control important.

Getting him to a neurologist is very important at this point; seizures that last long can be dangerous for a variety of reasons.Presumably he'll be evaluated, the cause of the seizures identified, and treatment begun. Anti-seizure medications suppress the frequency and intensity of seizures, but often require some dosage adjustments to get a good balance between seizure control and side effects.There are a variety of possible seizure triggers, and smoking marijuana would be inadvisable. As to the origin of the seizure disorder, assuming he has one, the neurologist may be able to identify it. But in many cases the origin of a seizure disorder cannot be identified.Make certain to get good information from the neurologist about what to do if your brother has another seizure. You should not try to restrain him, for instance. Instead, clear away any hard, sharp, or otherwise dangerous objects in the range of his limbs, get him onto the floor if he is seated or standing, and call 911 for emergency assistance. That's the general idea, but a neurologist can provide a lot more detail.","answer"

My son has had so many blood test 2 Mri and a Catscan because us headaches. And they all come back normal.LGS is know by having more than 3 kinds of Seizures and Medicines wont stop the Seizures. I also think the VNS has helped my Son Seizures.My Son also has A Service Dog now and that has helped also. The Service Dog can sometime let us know when he is going to have a Seizure just befroe he has one. My Son Seizures are fast and don't last that long.If your Doctor will not do as you ask and check for everything even white blood cell counts then I would get another Doctor..If you would like to talk to me you can send me a message with your phone number and I would be happy to talk to you. Or if you would like I can send you my phone number. Here is some info .http://www.ehow.com/about_5049916_heart-condition-causes-seizures.html  http://neurotalk.************.com/showthread.php?p=71974 http://heartdisease.about.com/cs/generallinks/a/syncopeseizure.htm http://www.suite101.com/article.cfm/seizure_disorders/39544   My son is almost of the Topamax . I am at a point were I want him to be happy and awake and not sleeping so much. Also I was first told that my son had add and adhd and he was on  drugs for that because his Teacher at School pushed for them and then two years latter found out he was having Seizures. Children who have Seizures can have a hard time learning and act out and they have know Control over it. Also the drugs they use for add and adhd can also cause Seizures.So some day they may and try and tell you this. And it is not true .The Surgery for the VNS took about 2 hours . They turn it on about two weeks latter. My son came home the same day. You can't take baths for about two months and know pools. As with all treatment for Seizures every person is different. Do they know what side of the brain your Daughters Seizures are comeing from?Hope this helps you and others .Nancy","answer"

I would be yelling at your Doc though Topomax has a side effect of Kidney stones and before he started the diet he should have been off the med or at least in the very begining of the diet. Any who he could be having kidney stones. Has your doc tested your son for LGS. My neuro was telling me that you can see on their EEGs that you can see weither or not they have LGS. I do have a question for you. You said your son has the VNS how is that working. We are trying the diet before we do the surgery and I would like another mothers opinion before I have them cut my daughter open. And what exactly is an Endocrinologist. That is one word I havent heard. I am sorry to hear about your daughter. My daughter has a little brother and I worry about him as well. Statistics show siblings have a 15% higher chance of developing epilepsy. So I keep a close eye on him as well. I have thought about talking to my daughter Doc about doing an EKG just because I feel like her heart beat is a little off. And sometimes she has a funny breathing pattern but all the Doc's that I have talked to about it pass it off like it is nothing. Well now I have another baby and he breathes fine and his heartbeat is normal so it makes me feel like I am not full of it and there is a reason why I should have it checked out. Do you know of any conditions that may cause hard to treat epilepsy in a child but has to do with their breathing patterns and heart rythems? That is one thing my husband I think about a lot. We also dont understand why Doc arent willing to do testing to figure out maybe why the child is having seizures in the first place, other then your infection tests. Anywho I am now rambling. Hope to hear back from you.","answer"

The best thing we can all do is be our childs best advocate and if we are not happy with what is happen with one Doctor then find another. And I am with ya on looking up everything . I have had to learn about seizures and  medicines from looking them up to. Make sure you childs Doctor runs blood work testing for every thing and anything. Also should be testing there Medicine threw bllod test to see how high they are .My son has absent seizures and headrop seizures and he also twiches in his sleep and he has also had seizures were he looks like he is going to fall .Doctors should also be doing an MRI or a Catscan .And A EKG.My son eeg shows that his seizures are on both sides of the brain . My son also has a VNS in him to help with his Seizures. Nothing has stopped my son Seizures but the Modified Atkins Diet for Seizures is helping some.And taking him off the Topamax .We have also been to see the GI Doctor and going again this Saturday because he has had some problems with going to the bathroom .Could be from all the Medicines but need to make sure because of family history. Your Doctors could aslo send you to see an Endocrinologist to see if there is anything they might be able to find out for ya. we went and they didn't find anything with my son.My Daughter also has Seizures now to she has absent Seizures on both sides of her brian also.They don't look like her brothers though. The hardest part is wanting to help your children and not being able to find out what is making this happen and finding something that works and stays working and worrying about all the side effects that come with all these Medicines. And so many people don't understand what we go threw and how we worry about uor children and if they will die at a young age. Also that they can have a stroke at any time. Stay strong for your children .I pray every night for every child and adult who have seizures and there parents.I thing to know is that you should get your children into speech classes. And when you or any one works with them on learning anything you will have to go over things many times. Because what they know one day the next they may not. This is because of the Seizures.God bless and take care.","answer"

Lucas had the hypsarrhythmia brain pattern until about 2 months ago so every time they did an eeg they were not able to see what type of seizurs he was having because the hypsarrhythmia clouds the eeg so much with chaotic brain patterns. After the dr put Lucas on a few meds that increased his seizures dramatically, i talked him into putting lucas on prednisone and colanzepam. It took the hyps away so the neuro wa able to see a seizure on the eeg but he did not tell me what kind it was. I assumed it was a myoclonic. Lucas has always been kind of shaky. before we knew he was havig seizures he wold shake and fall over all the time. now that he is on meds he doesn't do that his hands just shake a lot. They believe it may be essential tremors. I think that his neuro has always been stumped. The first med my son was on made him have drop seizures every minute...the second one did fine for a minute but then made him have drop seizures again....third time did the same...this time the neuro wanted to raise his meds and i told him no way that i nkew it was the meds making him have the drops more severe. So then we ended up with prenisone, topamax, and colanzepam...right now things seem to be going good with the seizures. the tremors hold him back quite a bit..he is not yet walking or talking...they say he has low muscle tone..ataxia and hypotonia...we still have no reason for all of this though..how can you treat something when you don't know what is causing it...i search day and night trying to find a cause for all of this. I think we may have to go to Ohio to the shriners for some help. Hope to talk to you soon :)","answer"

It is amazing what people will do when they get a hard to treat case like ours. If your in Oregon Dr Robert Wexler has a great rep. He is also an epileptologist.

Her most common are grand malls. The tremors could be from the meds. Those are common in the drugs he is on. I would tell your Neruo about it. In some states they do admit the child until there ketones are high enough to make sure they stop. But the problem with that is they practically starve the child for a week. It only took me one day to get Lilees ketones where they needed to be and I saw results right away. Good for you for researching though a lot of parents and people with epilepsy dont. So you should be proud of yourself. The more you know about you childs condition the more you and your doc can help him. One thing I would ask the doc though is to see if they see any types of lgs signs in his eeg. Where do you live? If you live in area I know I may be able to recommend a Doc to you whom I have seen. We have traveled quite abit for Lilee. If it is one thing I know it is how hard it is to find a doc that works for you and your child. Myoclonic jerks are hard to determine if they are acutal seizures we thought Lilees had those for the longest time but when we got an eeg done she had no signs of those types. We have found that is was a side effect from her meds. I know what you are going through if you need any help or just someone to vent to please do not hesitate to send me a message. Also one more thing. I know that at times it may seem that your doc knows it all about epilepsy but I have found that even the best Doc's can get stumped and will try almost anything weither or not it hurts the child to see if it works or not. Sometimes it is ok to say no to a treatment. Just remember that there is always more options. Hope to hear back from you.","answer"

It is pretty much an all meat all cheese diet. They get 10g a day of carbs. What i do with my daughter is two eggs in the morning with bacon or ham or sausage. All the meat is carb free cause its easy that way. lunch she gets walmart prand provolone (only brand i have seen that is carb free for prov.) with meat. Great Value (walmart) makes a juice that is completely carb free sugar free. (its like crystal light but almost a dollar cheaper.) Heavy whipping cream high in fat my daughter loves. I do have cream and half water so its not so thick i dont think she has noticed the difference between that and milk. Butter candies. drop of butter and some sugar and cinnamon on top. (thats the treat) There is no candy out there with really low carb and sugars it is always no sugar but there is always carbs. I am rambling sorry. In the beginning it was hard cause we wanted to give her the things she was used to but after a month its not really a problem. I would absolutely suggest the diet my daughter was in the same position your son is in now. It got so bad that the only way we could control her seizures was to sedate her. Good luck.P.S.

She has had a headache/migraine since last Sunday. On Thursday @ 3pm she took 2 muscle relaxers hoping to get some sleep & get rid of it. She woke up occasionally to pee. @ 12pm she woke us & went to bathroom. I heard a couple loud bangs & ran in there to find her on the toilet, her left arm was out straight with her fist clenched. Her head was tilted back/ up & her eyes were rolling back into her head while they were wide open. She would not respond to me. I ran & got the aspirin cuz she said earlier her heart felt like it was raceing & her ears were ringing. I had to pry her mouth open, which I was only able to get it open enough to push the aspirin in between her teeth. @ this point she started to relax her head & I helped lay it on the sink & called 911. While talking to them it seemed like she was coming around more & she started to have diareha. She then turned white & her lips began to turn blue. Her breathing was labored & she still would not respond to me. The EMS got there & put O2 on her. She started to come around. Due to know insurance she had to go to a county hospital. They immediately wrote it off that she just fainted & was dehydrated. She drank tons of water that day, they just would not listen to what happened & even seemed to treat the EMS guy like an idiot for brining her in & he told them ""you didn't see the way she looked when I first saw her"". They ran no test or blood work a just gave her the IV & shot for her migraine. Her BP when he EMS got here was 88/50. I don't know what her heart rate was or her pusle ox. They had her stand up as they checked her BP & said that it showed she was dehydrated. So for the long post. Does anyone have any answers please. I am terrified to leave her alone incase this happens again. I really feel if I woulld not have heard her she would have died.","question"

They need to see what the medicine is doing and you may find that you will have to try different ones and even a few at a time. And you may not even know it every time you have a seizure may people have seizures in there sleep to and don't know it. The thing your Doctor should do is a video egg in the hospital for a few days so they can really see what is happening with you and how may you are having and also run blood test to check for things that could cause seizures. like check your throid levels and blood levels and they could also do A EKG to and many other blood levles that could be causeung seizures. The other thing to look at is any medicines you might have taken that could cause seizures as a side effect. hope this helps.god bless","answer"

Tell her you want to give the med more time. But I would like you to keep in mind that sometimes just one seizure can lead to many many more. My daughter has been struggling with a hard to treat epilepsy. Her seizures how ever we are unable to treat with medication so we are using a different form of treatment. And as far as the age is concerned. I have spoke with our Neuro about age and have read lectures on age. And sometimes it has absolutely nothing to do with it. And that just ***** because you would think that the more information you give them about yourself and the type of seizures you have the more answers you will recieve but that isnt always how it works. Sometimes not even the Doctors know. But if your epilepsy is something new and you need a little advice here a little. If you are still having issues ask for another medication to be added on to the one that you are taking. See maybe if you are a canidate for the Keto diet (which is almost exactly like the atkins diet) if you arent feeling comfortable or your not getting the results that you feel you should be getting then see an epileptologist. Those guys are specialists when it comes to Epilepsy and the different treatments. And by the way good luck.Felisha","answer"

Keppra has been used for years and the only side affects that they show is drowsiness and moodiness. If and when you have to use the drug I would definetly recomend Keppra.

Also with paying for your meds for you daughter you do not have to pay for the. Research the Katidavis program. You can set up your daughter to have her meds paid till the day she turns 18. Also if there is a waiting period call your local weare office or whatever and ask for the number for the state or local epilepsy foundation or just look it up online.

When my son had his first Video EEG one of the Doctor told me that the drugs my son had been on and was on at the time could cause the Seixzures.I took my son off and he has never and will never go back on any of those drugs,some of them are just like speed.And I feel bad that I gave them to him and it has change him.My Son has been on Seizure Medicine since 2006 and still has Seizures.May people who have been told there child has ADHD OR ADD have found out latter that there child has Seizures.Some is because of the side effect to the drugs and others is because the person was Misdiagnode.

It took me a year to realize it. I had a grand mal seizure, they found a tumor, and my doctor put me on Keppra. A single mother of a teenager and a very hard worker, I turned into a deficient  emotional unproductive human.Over the 12 month period they upped my dose severely (because I was so out of it I am not sure but think 750 2x a day). They compensated the side effects by giving me adtvan then up to 4mg of xanax a day. What a nightmare. I dont remember much about that year. My memory got worse and worse and worse. My long-term memory was opened (i.e. all my bad memories that were put in denail throughout my life were remembered) but my short-term memory left. I was NEVER a person who cried, and then I started crying constantly...I mean once an hour, every hour, every day.I know that I finally stopped taking it when I went to get milk, put it in the refrigerator and then halfway up the steps ""remembered"" I needed milk. I went back to the store. When I put the second gallon in the fridge I saw the first one, looked at the receipts and saw a ten minute difference. YES...in 2 minutes I forgot what I just did.Finally, when I realized how bad my memory was, how emotional I had become, and how bad I was at being in any social environment, I fired my neurologist, scheduled brain surgery for the tumor that caused me to take Keppra, then weened off it. It took 3 months to migrate to Lamictal ( 200mg twice a day) and every week I felt the difference. It took a while to get of the side effect medication (xanax) which also made me very eradic.Please consider my story...for your son and for your life as well. I isolated myself from family, friends and work (at 35 years old) and basically dont recall most of my actions in that year of my life.It doesnt effect everyone the same, but it almost ended me having a functional happy life.

I had no history of any such seizures in the past. I was under a lot of tension and stress at that time. The first 3 seizures were severe, and all happened during sleep. I didn't know what was happening, but it seems my whole body stiffened, and i was making a shrieking voice. The first 2 seizures took almost an hour to come out of it. I was completely unconscious, even while i was dragged to the hospital. I was put in Valprid CR- 400 mg, 200mg twice a day, and the seizures stopped. As my epilepsy started at a very high age, i was told that most likely 3 yrs of continuous meds will completely finish the illness. However, a single day miss of the medicine, gave me a third seizure, which made me aware that missing the meds all together will anyways cause a seizure, and that the dosage has to be slowly reduced before completely finishing the dosage.After 2 yrs of taking Valprid, my doctor switched me to Lamosyn...again 400 mg, due to Valprid's side effects such as weight gain. Lamosyn was also equally good. At the end of 3 yrs i.e. in 2008, i slowly brought the dosage down to 200mg (of course with my doctor's advice). It was all going fine...till mid 2009. From 2009, i don't get seizures, but my epilepsy's symptoms have completely changed, now the seizures are in form of a kind of hallucination. I am sitting in my office..in vroad daylight, but in front of my eyes...i am in some other place...in evening time,...with some different family/ doing something completely different (it keeps changing)..if its a family also...i am so much there that i feel i have always been a part of it...or the other work i am doing in my second world is what i have been doing all my life. Stuck between 2 worlds...puts a lot of strain on my mind, and sends a kind of shiver through my body (completely invisible to others) straining my body completely too. I immediately try to come back to my senses, looking left/right. Sometimes...within a min i am back to my sense, with a strained body and mind. Sometimes, my transition to both the worlds keep going on for 15-20 mins too. I have to take Lamosyn immediately. But at the end of episode...i am completely drained of all the strength...and also have a strained mind. The heaviness in my head takes quite sometime to go.The episodes have increased in the recent past...and i have to take Lamosyn first thing in the morning to avoid the seizure early morning. And sometimes..(esp end of my menstrual cycle)...I have to take sometimes even 200 mg thrice a day too as they keep on recurring. I don't know what to do..and how to control it. My doctor is in Apollo Delhi, and after marriage i have shifted to Bangalore...so will be going to a neurologist very soon.Any suggestions..pls help. Y'day itself i took 200 mg in the morning, with an attack around 4 pm...another 100 mg which didn't control much..another 100mg. It stopped, at night also had my regular dosage of 100mg. A total of 500mg during day, still it recurred around 2 am (though a mild one), another 100mg.Don't knw what to do..","question"

But TLE, sometimes referred to as a complex partial seizure disorder localized in the (right) temporal lobe, can be well controlled with the right combo of meds.I suspect the neurologist you're planning to see will get this all sorted out. Some people with seizures need more than one med to gain good seizure control. Sometimes, a, med that works for a few years simply stops working well. So a good working relationship with your doctor will be very helpful. Seizure disorders can fade with time, but often they don't. A thorough neurological workup, likely including brain imaging, may help find any underlying issues involved, which in turn will help with treatment. Good luck with the neurologist appt.","answer"

There was a case (granted about 9 years ago, but it's going to be bugging me until I figure out what happened) Is there such a thing does anyone know, as someone freezing up and not being able to move as an after effect of a seizure -whether it progresses to unconsciousness or not? Even after 9 years I'm of course hesitant to mention it to an M.D.: I was driving along when I started to get light headed, I pulled over in a parking lot and started having a small seizure (an aura without losing consciousness). After it stopped and I felt better, I started home (yes, I know what everyone is thinking, but I've done it many times before. I always wait 'til I feel 100% again, which with me only takes a few minutes. I've had these since I was a month old, so I know how they tick.) Suddenly I just couldn't move. I KNOW I was NOT having another seizure (to make a long explaination short), but I just couldn't steer or brake or anything, but I could see hear and feel everything perfectly fine, just as I am right now. There apparently was a brief few seconds where I can't to this day for the life of me remember (momentary amnesia?) because the report said I ""drove through the backyards of houses and in between 2 houses to get back on the road"". I then like the flip of a light switch remember going back the other way down the road still unable to move at all, but still seeing and hearing everything just like now until.....well, I was screaming in fear as I seen a tree coming towards me but still couldn't understand why I couldn't just hit the brake or turn the wheel. After a seizure I'm like total confused and afraid of everything around me until I am fully back into it. It takes me awhile to be able to form words again and to balance again -NONE of which happened afterwards, so again I KNOW I didn't have another seizure. But this has been bugging me ever since....has anyone else ever experienced either of these? This kind of thing NEVER happened before and NEVER since. Does it make sense that I could have a new kind of seizure out of the blue after 30 years and then never have it again?","question"

I still cant wrap my head around how a person could Fake one. I guess the medical staff would have to be pretty dumb. You cant fake your mussels rippling or busing that appears as its happening, or the sudden drop in oxygen in your system... so yeah.my EEGs sometimes showed something abnormal, other times didnt. I think they were harder to trigger back then maybe because they were super mild. Id apparently just 'space off' and stop moving for several minutes or seconds, then start back to what ever it was I was doing having No awareness anything was amiss.I had a seizure a couple of times that I got suddenly really mad or hostile and kinda disoriented... it was weird. I cant recall if it turned into a well 'normal' seizure or not after tho. Seizures can do all sorts of weird things to a person.If you find a common trigger, like if you stay up and dont get enough sleep or something, you could 'provoke' one. But Id wait til you were seen.

These seizures don't knock him out like the tonic-clonic seizures, but if he has a few close together, he is often tired.""These happen like 5 times a day to me at most, i'm going to go to the doctor again and tell him that.I also heard that you're suppose to bring like a video for proof? How do I get something on video if its all random?! I mean I can try to ask my mom to record it, but I don't know if she can sit with a camera for a hour or two lol.By the way, thanks for the reply, it helps out.","answer"

The medications used to treat seizures are all so-called antiseizure or anticonvulsant meds, including Topamax, Valproate, Trileptal, etc. The choice of med depends on the type of seizure disorder, and some people require two meds (polytherapy) to achieve good seizure control. Meds are really the only way to reduce the frequency and intensity of seizures, though some people have seizure triggers (flashing light, for instance) and so avoiding triggers is important for them. The ketogenic diet (an extremely low carb diet, only to be undertaken with physician approval and supervision) can help some people with seizures, but is typically tried only after several different meds have failed to provide relief. The medications all do basically the same thing: they reduce the ""seizure threshold"" in the brain through one or several actions on neurons. In many cases, the exact biochemical mechanism is not understood. All of these meds have side effects, sedation being among the most common. Your doctor will go over the side effects with you, and you may opt for one med over another based on the side effect profile.Hope this info helps.","answer"

For photosensitive types, summer is generally more difficult, with longer days and more time spent outside. For people with allergies that can indirectly/directly trigger seizures through, for instance, altered breathing, then allergy season will increase the likelihood of seizures. For Sep-May seizures, I wonder if the school year is an associated factor. Does this woman go to school as a student or teacher, or have a child or sibling in school. The demands of being in school may lower seizure threshold.There's no easy way to identify the cause of a seizure disorder. The MMR and other vaccines haven't been found to be associated with the development of seizure disorders, at least not so far. Unfortunately achieving 100% certainty in medicine is virtually impossible. I live with this myself and have seen it many times. I don't like it, but I've had to make choices with far less than 100% certainty because waiting was not a practical option. One thing about seizures: the more you have them, the more likely you become to have them again.

I suffered with jerks, mostly of the arms and hands, but also occassionaly my mouth and head. I was reluctant to admit there was anything wrong with me and, despite my being a big guy and a varsity athlete since my sophmore year in high school, I suffered people making fun of me for my jerks. One morning, after a night of drinking and little sleep, while playing a computer game, I had a full blown seizure.  Two weeks later I spent 24 hours in the hospital having a brain scan while awake and asleep. The end result was I was diagnosed with Juvenille Myoclconic Epilepsy. Since then I am on Depakote and have not experienced either Myoclonic jerks or a seizure. My doctor, who is the head of Neurology, explained to me that it is impossible to tell for sure if you are at risk for suffering a seizure without an exam by a Neurologist. Since you are already on medication to control the Myoclonic jerks the idea of taking different medicine to control both should not be an issue. And the risks associated with having a seizure should encourage you to at least discuss this with a neurologist.BTW, I play video games and am on my computer close to 4 hours a day.  I also play college baseball.  The Depakote has actually let me live a near normal life. The only negatives are the medicine does make me tired, so I need more sleep than before I took the Depakote. AND, the medicine is processed through the liver so you really can't go out and just drink (I limit myself to two beers a night and have 16 oz of water after each beer - apparently consuming liquor increases the chance of a seizure and dehydration is a contributing factor).Hope this long answer helps, and I hope you think about going to see a neurologist.","answer"

My neuro tells me that sometimes if you can't find a cause they might actually stop after a while (I'm still waiting to see if that's gonna happen in my case, I've had this for almost two years now)I've got spinal myoclonus. I get jerks all over but mostly in the area around my abs and the more serious ones (in my abs) usually only come when I'm lying down. I always say that it will help me develop a six pack :) I'm taking Epilim (known as Depakote in the US) and Lamictal which hasn't stopped them completely but it helps alot. Side effects, like tiredness and lack of concentration, aren't the greatest but I'd take those over the jerks any day.I've found that stress and lack of sleep makes mine a lot worse so I try my best to avoid them.

Anyway, the ""absent seizures"" you described may just be strong auras (pre-seizure activity) that aren't breaking through to full blown seizures. Auras are different for different people. I get the Deja Vu thing (very common), really weird, where I might be having a conversation with you and I would swear it's a conversation we've had before, and I know what's going to come out of your mouth 3 seconds before it does. What struck a cord with me is the swallowing thing. When I have an aura, my mouth waters and I get a strange feeling in the back of my throat that makes me swallow a lot too. Also, while I feel flushed, I'm told I go very pale. So, while I obviously can't be sure, it sounds familiar in some regards. Is your dad currently on any meds? If so, he may want to discuss a small bump up or possibly adding a low dose of a second drug to get the seizure activity under control. I'll be the first to admit that it's not fun being on seizure medication. They all have side effects, some worse than others. Each effects people differently. He needs to work with his neurologist to find the one that's most effective with the least side effects. The thing to remember is that seizures can cause brain damage and worst case scenario, death. That's worse than any side effect, right? As far as the Bell's Palsy goes, I have to admit to complete ignorance in relation to epilepsy. All I can recommend is what I said in the last message.

My seizures started out of the blue in my early 20s. Until that time, I thought you were either born with epilepsy or it was brought on by brain injury or some other specific cause. I have since learned that many cases of epilepsy, like mine, are diagnosed as idiopathic (no known cause), and you just take your meds, adjust your life and live with it. Of course, you should try to find out if there is some treatable cause. Do the CT scans, MRIs, etc. to make sure you're ok, but be prepared for the fact that your neurologist will probably be much more interested in treating the symptoms than searching for a cause because, in most cases, they never find one.

At 4 yrs old I started seeing shutters go through her when a camera would flash or lights were turned on in a dark room, these progresses into countious and were diagnosed as myoclonic jerks. At 6 yrs old the gran-mal seizures started and she would have atleast one a week. Her seizures are under control now, partically by medicine, but  I have found that all her seizure like activity is brought on by stress (fear) or excitement and I can remove her from that cause andn talk her right through them. She will recover within less than 2 minutes and within 5 minutes you would never knew it even happend, she has no lasting effects or memory loss, she may be a bit weak and shakey for a bit but no other effects.We have seen neurologist at Helen DeVos in Grand Rapids Mi and neurologist at Childrens Hospital in Detroit Mi.Every test comes back normal and all scan show no irregularities (MRI, CAT, PET-FDG, EMG, EEG, EKG)We have seen Genesists at both hospitals also and noone can put a finger on whats going on.My daughter has taken many different meds in the past in trying to control these seizure like episodes. (Zonisamide, Lamictol, Topiramate, Clobazam)She currently takes Keppra (2500mg daily) Valproic Acid (750mg daily) Levocarnitine(1980mg daily) Klonipin(2.5mg daily) we use 1mg ativan tablets to help relax when needed and have diastat 7.5mgMy question is , what do you think?I am finding that even a simple trip to the grocery store is to much excitement for my daughter, she is happy and enjoys life. She just gets so excited in a happy way withn anything we do that she is almost daily having these episodes.I am wondering if we are using the right meds, or if there might be something better out there to help her relax more without compermising her. Also any ideas on diagnosis?                             thanks   Brenda","question"

I'm no doctor, this is all just info that I've come across in my search for answers. Are her symptoms by any chance worse in the mornings than the rest of the day? If the answer is yes, she might have juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.

A blood thinner is what more technically is called an anticoagulant (as warfarin, for instance). Most drugs for epilepsy have blood thinner properties and so they can add their blood thinning property to that of warfarin. This may cause an haemorrhage in some part of your body. A new drug which doesn't have that property, that effect, is Zebinix 800 mg or 1200 mg (find it on Google). Zebinix is sold in tablets and is being considered internationally as a success drug for the treatment of epilepsy, particularly, but not only, for people who can not take other drugs because they take daily those anticoagulants or blood thinners..","answer"

I went to a neurologist who did a 48 hour eeg and he said i had abnormal brain waves( prob the same ones that were found when i was 12) and he put me on keppra. when i asked him why it took so long for these abnormal waves to manifest itself he said "" i dont know, it could happen"" but here is where my issue lies with my diagnosis and what no neurologist could answer:1) why did these abnormal brain waves turn into epilepsy all of a sudden2) i have never had a full seizure. during any of them i was concious the whole time and was aware of what was going on. for example during the last one i had i told myself to open my eyes and i did and ""saw"" my eyes moving back and forth. i also moved my arm3) the only symptoms i have are a ""numbness"" feeling 4) these seizures only happen when i am sleeping and laying on my back5) since i am aware of what is going on, when i get that ""aura"" that happens before someone gets a seziure i cant stop it by waking up no doctor i have been to has been able to explain these things: how am i able to stay consious through them and tell myself to do things, why they only happen to me in certain positions, how can this be related to my accident so long ago but the most confusing question is ....how am i able to stop them?please help me.....i need a correct diagnosis","question"

That is why i have a seizure although like you they could'nt tell me why i was able to understand everything that was going on, why i know when im going to have one because i can start to feel it work its way up my left leg (where it always starts), and lastly they couldn't tell me why the seizures would only occur when i woke up in the morning from sleeping.

I have epilepsy and have had it for 25 years, i have been ttc for 6 years now. The risk of birth defects with epilepsy meds is higher but my neurologist told me that it is not much higher than for someone who does not have epilepsy 7% risk against 3% roughly. If a patient is on 1 type of med the risk is lower, if they are on several meds to control seizures then the risk is higher.  Some meds may cause a higher risk but the doctor will advise if the meds need to be changed. The risk of defect will reduce if off meds however this is not always possible and should not be done unless under medical supervision. I have now reduced my dosage with the help of my neurologist to a 500mg daily to help reduce the risk.I was also told most of the issues will occur with an increase in seizures when excessively tired during pregnancy and after the birth. The docs advise on how to reduce tiredness, e.g. dont breastfeed. Things like dont bath baby alone or change them on a high mat are things i was told about for safety after the birth.Your girlfriend should be taking 5mg folic acid daily (prescribed by doctor) to help reduce the risk of neural tube defects.  Hope some of this helps.E","answer"

I'll try answer your questions but I'm no doctor so don't swear your life on what I'm saying.Alot of anti-epileptics are known to have a higher chance to cause birth defects but the pros should be compared to the risk of not taking it. It is dangerous for both mother and fetus if the mother has seizures during the pregnancy therefore a doctor should not be too keen on letting the woman stop taking medication completely, another ""safer"" drug will be chosen. Safer in the sense that it has a lower risk of birth defects. The best would be to speak to your doctor and see what he recommends.There are so many different types of drugs because they all act in different ways. Some are central nervous system depressants (they slow down the signal form the brain) and others increase the amount of GABA (a substance that controls neuron excitability) in your system.I hope this helps in some way.

The neurologist here in HK where we are living at the moment said that the MRI was normal but there was some slight abnormality in the EEG on both sides of the brain.  He said she had a 70% chance of having another seizure in the next 3 years and suggested we put her on Keppra.  (He previously ordered the MRI because he thought that her earlier seizures, which both lasted less than a minute and were about 18 months apart, may have caused hippocamal sclerosis).  When we asked if she had epilepsy, he said no that she has ""epileptic tendencies.""  He also said that we could try giving her anti-convulsant medications -- Frisium -- whenever she gets a fever to reduce the possibility of a seizure. We found him rather alarmist and are really opposed to medicating her if it is not necessary. Does this make any sense?  We plan to go back to NYC to visit a pediatric epilepsy center for an evaluation but will not be able to do so for some weeks.  Any thoughts on whether this seems to be jumping the gun or appears within customary treatment norms would be greatly appreciated.","question"

After all of that, I would suggest seeing an epilepsy specialist who can do a complete workup.  Though this my prove to be inconclusive, it may also identify a problem that can be treated. I wouldn't be too concerned at this point.  The seizures she's had have been really quite mild and she's come out of them quickly.  I would chalk it up to the fever, but it's still worth a second look.Good luck!","answer"

I'm menatally fried and aggitatedfrom this. Some days it seems it doesn't stop. I went to a nuro 2 years when I was on Hep C treatment. He did that tapping on the knee and supposedly I was having the jerks at the same time so he said from his reflex tap. Had 3 day EEG(?) and had to mark down my twicthes, but apparently no sign of seizure disorder. They seem to be getting worse and the sensatio is much stronger. It's become a big part of my daily life and I no likey...lol. Does anyone have something like this? The strong yet ridiculous twitcing I could maybe get away with, but the sharp jags of pain I can't. Any advice, any type of tretment for tis..anything? There's no way i can go on through life like this.Thereare days I want to leave just becuase of my loud shrieing cockaiels. i just feel so obverwhelmed. Oh please heellp.

"Seeking Information","https://www.medhelp.org/posts/Epilepsy/Seeking-Information/show/1397797","PeterPutts","2010-11-20T03:54:42-05:00","Hi,Found this forum a few months ago and find some of the responses given to be helpful. I will raise my concerns, along with some brief history; it will help in answering my question(s). This is a bit long, so be patient.When I was 16 I had my first seizure. It was 11:30 pm and I was playing a game called Unreal Tournament when it happened. First, I felt my left hand start to shake violently, then my right shortly after, I wanted to call for help, but couldn't...and that's when the panic kicked it. I felt myself slowly falling off of the chair and can't remember anything from that point, until about 12:00 am. I felt confused and scared and felt as if I was going to die. My mom and bro called the EMTs and I was taken to the hospital. Nothing was done, I was simply sent home. But, I remember one of the EMTs telling me to eat something sweet every once in a while. For about 2 days my muscles were tight and ached, and my tongue was badly bitten, which made eating quite uncomfortable. I started clinic and was prescribed trileptal; which made me sick everytime I withdrew from it and started it back. My doc also told me to start exercising to increase bone density.The 2nd time it happened, about a year after, and it was worse. It was during theday and I was watching television, it was 3:30pm (That's right, everytime I've had a seizure, I checked the time just before it happens; not strange, as I'm constantly checking the time)...I was on the living room couch and it started in the same way, my left hand started shaking, followed by my right, but this time I could feel saliva running out my mouth...I passed out and regained consciousness about 30 mins afterward. The same feelings of confusion and fear overcame me. No one was home this time and after I got my bearing and coordination back a bit, I phoned my brother, and was taken to the hospital. I was eating on a ceramic plate when it happened, it broke and it cut my chin open; I needed 5 stitches. This time, another doctor dealth with me, he stitched the wound, gave me a tetanus shot and recommended I stay away from the television or video games, get adequate rest and eat healthy. My doctor at the clinic also recommended this. My medication was changed to dilantin, but it still made me sick. They did an EEG on me about a year later and found everything to be normal, but I knew something was wrong. Another year passed and I never had another seizure; so my doc gave me my last prescription, but I didn't fill it; I hated the drugs, made me feel too sick.After another year passed  I never got another attack. So, that's about 3 years since my last attack. From my own reading, I read about photosensitive epilepsy and since the attacks started, I stayed away from flashing lights, clubs, video games and I hardly watch TV, but my curiousity got the better of me. I read some where that in photosensitive epilepsy, that the seizure may not always occur at the time of stimulation, it can occur hours or days afterward. My curiousity got the better of me, and just to see if I was really over this, in 2009 (I was 22 in '09) I went to youtube and looked at several seizure-causing(I know, not smart - I came to regret it). About a week later on, while on the computer, the same thng happened...shaking left arm, then my right...then I pass out. This time I actually broke my jaw and had a few bumps on my head afterward. The tongue bites were worse as well as the pain and soreness a few days afterward. I was taken to the hospital where they monitored me for the night, then sent me home.And lastly, before my first seizure, a few months prior, I remember waking up in bed having the same feeling I would have after I had a seizure. I was scared and afraid I was going to die and very confused as to my surroundings and didn't know what caused it. It took me about an hour to get back to sleep and I awoke the next morning worried, but feeling refreshed. I don't think I had any muscle pain, but only after my first seizure did I relate the two as the feeling was the same.My question to you, what do you think this is? I'm not looking for a strict medical diagnosis, just some opinions and advice from people who are more knowledgeable or have more experience with it. The EEG results didn't show anything out of the ordinary, mind you, the EEG test was done a while after I started medication. I didn't have a seizure for about a year before they did that EEG test (that's very backward to me). But, I ask, what does this sound like? I'm believe it to be epilepsy and would appreciate any insight on the matter.Thanks,","question"

Did they diagnoses it with a EEG? Sometimes it takes a while to get the right dose of a drug or the right drug before you get stabile. YOu will get through this. The feelings you have may be a precursor to another attack but you will get through it and eventually feel better. I would try to listen to calming music or meditate because anxiety and stress don't help. But, maybe you should call your neurologist and tell them how you are feeling. They may need to up the dose of your drug or change it.  It probably takes a bit of time for the body to get used to this change in drugs until you can get a grip on it. You may want to read the Spiral Staircase by Karen Armstrong. You may not relate to it in the beginning but her symptoms may explain how you are feeling. She took 10 years to get diagnoses so it is good you did get diagnosed but I'm sorry you got eplilpsy.

We had to switch doctors due to insurance issues (don't get me started on that subject). We like the doctor we are with now but I'm not sure he's listening to us. My daughter HATES taking any meds. I have to force her to do it all the time. She's 16 now and knows what can happen when she stops. She hides the pills or complains about upset stomach or many other problems. I can not stand over her all the time to make sure she takes them since I have a full time job and another daughter with medical problems.She never had a grand mal seizure until she started taking depakote. When she skipped pills, she had a seizure. This passed February, she was suddenly diagnosed with polymyositis and she's taking more meds plus getting IVIG monthly. They recently lowered her meds for the polymyositis and I found out she lowered her meds for seizures too (not by doctor recomendation). She just had an EEG today to check how her seizures are going. I'm not a medical person but I watched her the whole time, knowing she probably hasn't had depakote in a few days (I found a pill hidden again). I did not see any seizure activity in her face and also watching the monitor I didn't notice any there either. After the EEG, I asked her when she last took depakote. She said last Saturday (that was almost a week ago).I've been told these seizures are something she can out grow which would be super great for her. I am very concerned about her not taking the depakote but I'm also glad that she hasn't had any seizures while not taking it. I do have a call into our neuologist but I guess I'm looking for a second opinion. Since she has been taking the depakote, she has not gained weight but she has become very moody (could also be the teenage thing). I am getting after her to get back on the depakote even if she stops taking her poly meds since that has almost gone away. I understand she wants a ""normal"" life but I don't want to put her in danger for that to happen.","question"

My son can be rather moody at times too.

I am not quite sure I understand what they are. My son is 2 years old and began having seizures for 6 days in late July this year before they medicated him 3 weeks ago. Since that time, though my son is on Keppra, I have found some naturopathic herbs that will not interfere with the Keppra, yet they assist with preventing seizures. It is very frustrating when the doctors don't listen or validate your concern and drum up their own conclusions. I feel that Children's Advil caused my son's seizures. The doctors said that wasn't very likely and looked at me like I was a quack. Yet if it is not very likely~that still leaves a chance that it could be. I did research and printed it for the neurologist and she dismissed it without a second thought and offered to dose my son with more advil to test it  and observe~I told her no thanks and that I could not do that to my son again. If you would like the name of the website that I get my herbal info. and tinctures let me know. It may not cure your daughter, but it could help.","answer"

Left without hope after their insurance runs out, the mother presses on, studies everything she can find out about the illness, and, against the wishes of her local doctor, takes her son to Baltimore for treatment with the controversial ketogenetic diet.The title of this movie-made-for-television, First Do No Harm, comes from the Hippocratic oath which doctors take as part of their vocation.However, in many cases physicians are loath to recommend procedures not because they do anyone harm but because their efficacy is not supported by scientific research. This is the case when four-year-old Robbie (Seth Adkins) is diagnosed as having a type of epilepsy for which the cause is unknown. His parents, Lori (Meryl Streep) and Dave (Fred Ward), agree to a series of excruciating drug treatments which only seem to worsen his condition. Their situation becomes more complicated when they learn that their health insurance policy has lapsed.Then Lori discovers a regimen called the Ketogenic Diet; one-third of the epileptic children on this diet have experienced no additional seizures. Robbie's parents are furious with his doctor (Allison Janney) for not telling them about this treatment and then refusing to facilitate their trying it. Instead, she recommends brain surgery for the boy.The finale of the drama demonstrates the distance some families have to go to take control of the health and welfare of their loved ones. First Do No Harm presents a blistering attack on the rigidity and insensitivity of the medical establishment.Outstanding performances from both Meryl Streep and child sensation, Seth Adkins.

I understand his reasoning behind what he did, but I disagree with how he did it, if that makes sense. I would never stop him from spending the night and being with other children his own age at slumber parties. I would have a discussion with the parents of the person he's staying the night with and express the importance of him taking his meds and at what time to give them, I would even call around that time to make sure they didn't forget, because if they don't have a child that takes medicine on a regular basis, I understand that they might have forgotten ( not on purpose) but because we are all human. I encourage Trevor to do things any other kid his age would normally do and I also try to do things with my kids. I sometimes feel guilty because of the hours that I work, but on my days off I try to make up for it by taking the boys to the movies or out to eat as a special treat.  Now I have a 13 yr old (Trevor who has seizures) and an 8 yr old who gets into a lot of fights because he thinks he's protecting his brother. My sister tells me all the time that I am their mother not their friend and that they can't get away with everything and that I spoil them. I don't think that I spoil them, but I guess I do let them get by with more than I normally would if Trevor didn't have his medical condition. Trevor has a cell phone with every number that I could think of from his peditrician to family member numbers in case something happens that way someone can get a hold of me no matter what. I work from home doing technical support for a major corporation so that I am readily available in case an emergency does come up. I have everything in place if something does happen but I explain to both my boys that if ""mommy"" didn't work we wouldn't be able to enjoy the things we do or have a place to live or a car to drive. I also have a savings account for both boys especially Trevor because I do worry about his future and think about ""the times when I am not going to be here to take care of him.""  I have two nephews one who will be 18 and another who will be 16 and they are extremely mature for their ages. I want my oldest nephew who Trevor loves more than anything to be in charge of helping Trevor with his money just in case he's not able to. I'm trying to look ahead and make sure that he is taken care of when I am not here anymore to be able to do it for him. If there is something that I haven't thought of that some of you who are more experienced with this can let me know what I should do and the procedures I should take to secure it, please let me know. I appreciate each and everyone of you who has given me advice on this, you have really helped me more than I can say. It feels really good to be able to talk to someone who knows what me and my son is going through and it's really nice because you all know more about what I should do and how I should go about getting it done. Thank you all for this, I greatly appreciate it.","answer"

I just sat down and cried.  It has been one struggle after another. When my son was 18 months old his biological father brought him home from a weekend visitation with a bruise that covered the entire left side of his face, but since he couldn't talk, I couldn't prove anything. When I asked his ""father"" and i say that term lightly, he told me that the bruise just appeared. It was bull and I knew it, and yes I went after him and had every intention on hurting him.  My father ended up pulling me off of him. We had no idea that the hit to my son's head would result in this. We had no idea he was even having partial seizuers until he was 7 years old. He was diagnosed with ADD because he was spacing out and we thought he was daydreaming.  He had his first grandmal seizure at the age of 7. That seizure was so bad he foamed out of his mouth and came close to quit breathing on us. When he was in the hospital they done an eeg and to seizure activity was in his left temporal lobe which is the side of the head he was hit on. He was at first put on Trileptol and that controled them for about three years until he reached the max dose then at age 10 he was put on Keppra not the XR that wasn't until he had another bad grand mal until he was 11 then his neuro upped his Keppra to 1500 Keppra XR. He was still having break through partial seizures during this whole time. It was to the point he was losing his short term memory and wasn't able to retain anything he learned in school. These past couple of years has been the worst for him in school. His neuro said that due to the increased seizures it has destroyed that part of his brain where his learning and memory capabilities are. He had a bad seizure on the 4th of July and another on Labor day and that is when his Keppra when up to 3000mg, and I was told that he was showing signs of autism. I had asked the Dr if that wasn't somthing a child was born with, he said no, that the seizures could bring that on as well, and his peditrician confirmed the diagnosis.  It hurts me to see him go through this, if I could take it away I would in a heart beat. When you have a child, this is not someting you want them to go through or even something you think about them going through.  If anybody had advice on how I should go about handling this, please I'm open to any suggestions. Should I start another savings account besides the one I have for him, to help with his care once he gets older. I'm worried about his future and what I should do now to start preparing for that should something happen to me to where I'm not able to care for him anymore. I have a wonderful husband now who helps me out everyday with him and is very good with him. I won't lie and say that Trevor doesn't test my patience at times or that I don't get frustrated. My husband will tell me to take a break and he's just wonderful with him and Trevor responds to him the way he sometimes won't with me, I guess because I'm mom and he knows how to push my buttons.  I have a younger child too who loves school and is really good with his older brother. He helps him with his homework and everything.  I work from home so that I am able to be there incase Trevor needs me at any point, but I depend on my youngest a whole lot and I feel guilty for that. He is way mature beyond his years and he will tell me, ""don't worry mom, I'll take care of Trevor, he's my brother and that's what brother's do.""  Now I worry that I have put to much on Cole, and I try to do things with him that normal 9 year olds do.  I'm not at a complete loss as to how to cope with this and am wondering if maybe family counciling should be something I consider.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated and welcomed.

Drug treatment can also cause sedation and influence mood.","answer"

I've done some research and I read that some of my hallucinations, like colours changing or objects moving, are not typical visual hallucinations and are more indicative of a neurological condition, same with the voices that I hear and can't make out what they're saying. And there is this thing called inter ictal psychosis, or psychosis in between seizures, where such hallucinations and transient delusions (similar to mine, and unlike the chronic delusions of schizophrenia) are present. I get simple partial and tonic clonic seizures by the way, and I used to get absence seizures.So, seizure activity can really mimic psychiatric symptoms. Now I have to wonder if my antipsychotic-resistant psychosis is psychiatric or due to my under treated seizures.","answer"

Seizures or epilepsy is a manifestation in the disturbance  in the electrical activity of the brain. This affects the brain's normal functions and produces changes in a person's movement, behavior or consciousness. The following symptoms may indicate someone has epilepsy:  short periods of blackout or confused memory; occasional ""fainting spells"" in which bladder or bowel control is lost with extreme fatigue; episodes of blank staring; brief periods of no response to questions or instructions;dazed behavior; being unable to talk or communicate for a short time; repeated movements that look out of place or unnatural; sudden fear, anger or panic for no reason;  odd changes in the way things look, sound, smell or feel; or muscle jerks of arms, legs or body.In your case, it would be difficult to make a diagnosis of epilepsy without appropriate evaluation. Diagnosis of seizures or epilepsy is with physical examination and EEG.  If it recurs, it would be best to see your doctor for proper diagnosis. Take care and regards.","answer"

My 9 year old was diagnosed with Epilepsy a year and a half ago. He suffered a massive seisure, and since the initial seizure a lot of complex partial seizures.They generally happened at night, and he woke up feeling odd with enough time to walk to my room before the seizures started.He is on Trileptal, which was gradually increased to control his seizures, which it is now doing very well.We had noticed a lack of concentration and odd behaviour, but put it down to adjusting to medication, and maybe just dealing with Epilepsy. He also tends to be quite anxious with not a huge amount of self confidence.He would do something a bit peculiar, just to see what would happen, and not really think about the consequences, i.e. he dropped some heavy stones into my sister in laws' favourite vase( Wedding present from Bridesmaid) to see what would happen! He is quite a well behaved boy, doing ok is school, but recently he is getting into a bit of trouble re his concentration. It takes him a lot longer to take things down from the board than previously, and occassionally his teacher writes it in his journal for him out of frustration. He regulary loses his stuff, pencils, homework etc. Getting him to stay sitting down when doing his homework can also be very frustrating at times, and regularly he starts chatting about totally irelevant things in the middle of doing homeworkAlso, I find his behaviour at home a little odd at times, and think that his 6 year old brother may act more maturely than him regularly. A friend mentioned that he may have ADD or ADHD, as seemingly there is a strong link to people with complex partial sesures having either of these conditions too.Your thoughts?","answer"

When I have a seizure, I get a strange feeling, and nothing else. No twitching or grand mal seizures. When my seizures are strong, I have a feeling that everything is fake, almost as if someone told you that you are in the Matrix.My doctor started me on 250mg of Keppra once a day, 90 minutes before laying down to go to sleep. After a week, it had reduced the amount of seizures I had (I have them everyday, probably about 50 a day), but had not stopped the seizures (probably reducing the amount I had by one-third). I called the doctor and was put on 500mg of Keppra once a day, 90 minutes before laying down to go to bed. I have been on this new dose of 500mg for 2 days now, and my seizures have become a little bit better (probably about 10 percent better than what they were on 250mg) so far.Here is my question for all you Keppra takers with partial seizures: How much Keppra do you take, and how long did it take before you seizures completely stopped?Thank you for reading!","question"

Six months ago after a night out I was walking through the town center and suddenly out of nowhere I got a strange feeling of been lightheaded and disconnected from my environment and felt like i was going to faint, but obviously i put it down to the hangover and after a while the feelings went away and i didn't feel it again. Until several weeks later I felt it again once again it was after a night out so again I blamed it on this, a week or so later i got the feeling again but this time i hadn't drank any alcohol for a week, i was concerned but i let it pass. Months past and i gradually started to feel worse and it became more frequent. Symptoms .Starts suddenly,end suddenly .Lasts around 15-30mins, once finished i feel really tired and then 15 mins later i will feel fine again .Made worse by    alcohol, lack of good sleep, and especially heat .Feel spaced/zoned out , i feeling like im not really their, like things are happening around me and find it hard to focus, in a world of my own but aware the feeling is not nice, for example i went for a meal with my girlfriend and whilst walking home i suddenly felt sick (no alcohol) so we went into a bar so i could sit down and get a drink of coke, when sat down i spaced out she was talking to me and i was staring vacantly across the room, saying yes every now and again as i could hear her speaking but not take in what she was saying .Feel faint/lightheaded . Sometimes like im going to be sick .Can sometimes be worse after eating  .last week week my scalp felt numb and tingled .Feel mentally slow, find it hard to do something simple like read or do simple math, or write something like this.hard to concentrate. .Feel better when sat down  .Feel like this most days (once a day) .Auto pilot- on one occasion i was shopping for my girlfriends birthday present and the feeling came on and afterwards , i was walking around the town center aimlessly and but i was aware of this feeling in my mind. .Recently i have felt alot more thirsty and have the increased need to urinate, like if i have even a mouth full of liquid i will need to urinate 15- 30 mins later .Asked my parents if i had any problems as a child they said i had nothing wrong with me apart from between the age of 3-5 i frequently had night terrors, and when aged 15 went through a stage of sleep walking. .Sometimes it feels like it builds throughout the day and the more stressed or agitated i get or the hotter i get the more likely i am to feel this. .It can happen any where, its happened whilst on a train, shopping, restaurant, or just laid in bed, or watching TV .On four occasions of the past two years i have had a feeling of racing thoughts like my mind was going 100mph which then slowly calms down, this has only happened after lack of good sleep and when feeling stressed out, although one of my earliest memories as a child at the age of 4/5 feeling it been really scared but find it difficult to explain to my parents. I've been to the doctors 4/5 times, who at first said he thought it would be a virus which would go of its own accord, took some blood tests which where all fine, ive been back and yesterday and he has referred me to a specialist to test me for seizures i assume partial seizures. I've never had any problems in my life and live a happy normal life, never felt depressed have a girlfriend and have just got in to university so i have plenty to be happy about and had nothing like this before. Its really getting me down, and i want to atleast find out whats wrong with me as its hard in the unknown. I know i have written alot but this way i feel i can get it all down, as its hard to say all of this to your doctor in one go. Its hard to explain to people and they don't always sympathie as its not something physical people can see, and i just wondered if any one has felt the same or knows someone who has. I'm aware it could be a seizure but im also aware it could be something like a panic attack either way it could be something else.

Especially in your case.The psychiatrist told me it was depression and prescribed me anti-depressants, but I told her that I wasn't depressed and I was havin gthe greatest time in college.  But, she told me that it was standard procedure for severe stress.  Well, I listened and took them and she was wrong and the episodes increase to 4 a day instead of once in a while.Later, I saw a Neurologist to get it all straightened out and found that I had Complex Partial Epilepsy.  From what I have read in your case it seems like this might be your case too because when I was younger I was the same way and the doctors took blood tests but never found anything.  Well, with epilepsy blood tests won't find anything.I have been through a lot of testing and procedures trying to control my case and also have done a lot of research on complex partial.  Here is what triggers it:1.  Lack of sleep  (Get at least 8 hours)2.  Stress   (Now that you are in University things may get harder)3.  Physical Stress (This I have just learned for myself because I used to be a good athlete and then let my body slip away.  So, when I began exercising again the stress it put on my body again caused me to have siezures more frequently, but as my body got back into shape the stress on the body started to reduce.  Heat is also considered in this. b4.  Drinking  (Because dehydration causes severe stress on the body and I have been in situations where I have been at concert in hot weather and had a siezure because I had been drinking a lot of alcohol and dehydration set in)What helps reduce it:1.  Get necessary amount of sleep2.  Exercise (This will reduce stress levels greatly and will help with getting good sleep)3.  Marijuana  (If you are not the type to exercise or do not have the time this is recommended by all neurologists and all people who have epilepsy to use, to istantly reduce stress and help with sleep if you are an insomniac like me)4.  Medication (There are plenty of meds out there just talk to a neurologist, I have been unfortunate and have tried 7 and none have been able to help except for the marijuana, but here in the U.S. it is not legal for medicinal use)","answer"

I think to be honest check your tegretol leaflet and see if any of the symptoms are listed on it.If memory loss is on it I would recommend trying Keppra (Levetiracetam), it is quite new and has virtually no major side effects. I have been on it since just before christmas, and I feel better and my memory is improved. The frontal lobe is actually the memory part of your brain, so unfortunately it is inevitable your memory is a tadge unreliable. I can sympathize with you as I have epilepsy, and have done for the past 4 1/2 yrs. The next few months will be hard but you can get through it.

I'm turning 21 years old in a few days from today. I've had this problem since i was about 19 years old. When i sit down i'm fine, or when i'm standing one spot on the floor for example leaning on the wall i'm fine, but when i try and walk away from that spot or when i try and stand up from my seat and walk i have some sort of spasm. It's like i open my eyes wide, i don't lose consciousness but i tend to tilt my head to one side and i stay in a stiff manner for a couple of seconds. Its like something inside my whole body is trying to control the functions or my arms, fingers, neck, legs and toes. Sometimes i try and curl up my toes to try and help from getting this attack. It happens a couple of times a day and only lasts for a few seconds. I try to hide it from everyone. It always happens to me when i get put on the spot and i get called unexpectedly for example if i am in a waiting room where you must be seated and names are being called out and if i am seated and my name gets called unexpectedly i must get up quickly and go and if i do that i normally get this attack. I really don't know what to do and i don't know if its epilepsy related. I don't get those seizures which causes constant shaking or jerking like epilepsy patients do. This is like just slow and uncontrollable. I'm very embarrassed and i don't want to go out much and work as this puts me off and it scares me if people notice this happening to me in public. I try to be very discreet when these attacks happen to me. It's very hard to explain but any help or advice would really help me. Thank you.","question"

It wasn't bad, it was just really bothersome because whatever I was doing it kinda looked like I was doing stomach crunches at the same time. I had 2 ""fits"" before I started medication. Those were really bad because the jerks were super strong and I could only lie down. I also knew exactly what was going on around me and I was able to speak but it was really difficult because it felt like the wind was getting knocked out of me with each jerk. I still get jerks every now and again but it's not that bad, they usually happen when I'm lying down.I saw a neurologist, in fact I saw her 8 times in the space of a year because my jerks would respond to the medication then it was almost as if started tolerating it and the jerks would come back. In March she referred me to a more senior neurologist because she said it was unfair to me to be a medical mystery to her when someone else could help. This neuro really knows his stuff but like her, he only has his suspicions. If I could, I would go back to my first neuro because her bedside manner is so much better, I've seen the one I'm currently at 3 times and I still don't like him.I've had basically every test there is, except for a brain biopsy which the neuro said would be the absolute last thing we would do if his suspicions became more of a diagnosis and he just wants to confirm it.

They were so strong that it looked like I was actually bending forward so my parents took me to casualty. I also was hyperventilating and had heart palpitations and a dry mouth. The doc there said that it was just a panic attack (he didn't even come do a check up on me or run any tests) and that I just needed to stop stressing so much (I had written 4 tests in the past 2 weeks.) We would have agreed with him if it wasn't the fact everything still carried on after I was sedated so we headed off to our GP later in the day. By the time we reached him the jerks weren't continuous but there was still alot of them. The GP at least ran some blood tests and when everything came back normal he also declared that it was a panic attack.The jerks still weren't stopping even though they weren't continuous, there was about 40 every minute, and I also developed a hand tremor so we decided that I should see a neuro. She ran millions of tests which included blood tests (ANA, vitamin levels, kidney/liver function,) MRI scans, EEG, EMG and lumbar puncture and everything came back normal. She even did and EEG when I had another ""attack"" and that also came back normal. She declared that I had spinal myoclonus and we started treating that.Clonazepam was my first option but that made the jerks feel 10 times worse (we think that may actually have triggered the second attack because I took it one night and the attack happened the morning after) Then I was on sodium valproate which was effective, but it seemed like my body started tolerating it and the dose kept on having to be increased, which eventually became too high for my body to handle and I suffered from suspected valproate toxicity. ""Suspected"" because the levels in my blood were still within the normal range. That caused a whole confusional episode where I didn't know what day it was, my speech was slurred, I had extreme somnelence, strange behaviour and I don't remember anything from that day. So we lowered the sodium valproate to a third of what it was and we added levetiracetam, which was also effective but like with the sodium valproate on its own, my body seemed to start tolerating it and I eventually reached the maximum recommended dose. That's when my neuro decided to refer me to someone more senior (that was back in March this year.) He now has me on sodium valproate and lamotrigine.Sorry for the long history, I just thought that a bit of insight would be good before I listed my symptoms. Here is the list of symptoms that I'm currently experiencing:Spinal myoclonus in abdominal areaHand tremor that sometimes spreads to my whole armSpeech difficulties, written and oralBlurry vision and sometimes see floatersFasciculations in my legs Memory disturbancesHeadachesShort concentration spanFatigue""Confusional episodes"" (that's what the neuro calls them, I basically can't make sense of what people are saying and I'm unable to speak as well but I know that it's happening)At first this new neuro said it was just spinal myoclonus as well but when I went to go see him yesterday, which has now been the third time, he suddenly said that there's a 60% chance that I have epilepsy and he gave me these ""options""1.

There is also a Viedo there that your Parents and Friends should watch so they know what to do when you have a Seizure. The Epelpsy site has a lot of info in there about different kind of Seizures.Stress and not the right amount of sleep can cause Seizures.I would also start taken Vitamin B6 and B12 also Omega 3-6-9 these are very good for the brain.The Doctors should also check your Thyroid levels and sugar levels and run blood test at leat 4 times a year to make sure they medicine levels are where they should be and they should also keep and eye on your Liver levels. Start keeping track how many times these happen and what you where doing and eating.

A friend and my boyfriend have said its ADHD but im not hyperactive im quite a sit back and relax kinda person. i decided to go even though i have never visited a doctor since i was about 14 when i sewed my finger because some of my college teachers were pointing out just how much i would lose concentration even in classes i enjoyed.The twitching is my main worry as if it is a form of epilepsy i wouldnt want to ignore it and let it get really bad to the point where it would ruin my life.P.S. sorry if ive misspelled!","question"

I usually had auras occur with my seizures before it happened so I knew it was coming on before it occurred.  Over the years though, my seizures have gotten progressively worse. It went from being mostly petit mal seizures for the first 20 years of my life and then changed to being stronger petit mal seizures and grand mal seizures for the next 23 years on a regular basis. My seizures have never been successfully controlled by any drug i've taken.  I've been trying to find the underlying cause to them besides having been vaccinated way too soon in life.  I recently found out i have heavy metal toxicity which i'm working on removing.  Now i'm going to get tested for food allergies to see if there could be any possible seizure triggers there.  Since I've discovered that food allergies can cause things from seizures to schizophrenia, that's my latest investigation into what might be worsening things for the past 23 years.

Good luck. Hope you find the information helpful. The doctors never told me anything either.  Just had to figure it out on my own through trial and error.","answer"

I don't feel myself for long periods of time. This is not like me as I am a very active wife and mother of two boys with a full time job. However,  I had my very 1st siezure one week ago and was admitted to the hospital for several days. Nothing showed on the CT scan, MRI or the EEG. But... I didn't have a seizure during the EEG.... are these tests absolutley conclusive when looking for reasons for recurrent tonic-clonic seizures in an otherwise healthy 29 year old female??? I mean I keep having them and it's really getting me down. I am on Tegretol and other meds for controlling it but just don't feel any different. This all started with me having a headache that lasted a month. Nothing seemed to help it. It made me sick to my stomach and the 1st time I had the siezure, I was in bed and that's what my husband came home to. I have not been right since. Will this go away? Is it Epilepsy, or what? One doctor says maybe another one says it's stress. What am I to do .... keep popping pills forever? I mean come on! This is scaring me & my family. I don't want to deal with this but if it is to be dealt with than where do I go for more specialized help? I am in the Savannah, GA area. Thanks for any info you can give.

Same thing with me. I think with the Equipment on we are so limited to what we do and where we go, that things that trigger the seizures are not experienced.In my case they were comfirming absence or partials. The tech  person told me to chill out for the 24 hours and not move around too much, because if the wires move they give a false reading or could come lose from the head,In my case things that set me off are motion, things quickly moving around me, me walking around or making quick turns, moving rushing/pouring water, shiny things or standing in boring places.So, ya same thing got into a crowed commotion and zoned out there in the hospital right after the EEG equipment was removed.Whats up with that/Oh, I started these zone outs 4 years ago after being rear ended at a stop light by a Jimmy. Had back neck, rotator cuff damage and constnt dizziness and brain injury, I had a major head/brain injury at 6yrs ending up with a plate in the side of head but not seizures but tons of scar tissue on fronal and both tmeperal lobs.

Since last August I have had two surgeries, including a total hysterectomy. In October 2008 my Dilantin level was 19.9. In January 2009, I was diagnosed as severely deficient in Vitamin D (D2 was less than 4; D3 was 8).  In February 2008, I started having some ""spells"" that weren't quite seizures but did feel like I was going to faint but I didn't.  I felt like the bottom just totally dropped out of my energy and it happened quickly. I would have several of these a week.  Since then, I have had a new MRI (normal), and MRA (slightly enlarged -- 2mm -- left artery), and an EEG.  While I was having the EEG, I had one of these spells.  I told the technician at the time that this is what I was talking about.  The neurologist said the episode on the EEG showed I fell asleep.  He refused to order a new Dilantin level check.  He said if I wasn't having seizures, I was within range and did an eye movement test and said I wasn't toxic.  I have been on the generic Dilantin for years rather than the name brand.  I was taking 400 mg one night and 500 mg the next night for an average of 450 mg.  My nurse practitioner ordered another Dilantin level check when I had another spell at their offices.  My blood level was 17 at that time and I had taken 200 mg that morning.  At my third appointment my neurologist put me on the name brand Dilantin and reduced the dosage to 400 mg.  I am finally starting to feel better by degrees.My questions:  1. Could I have become toxic on the generic Dilantin even though I was within range?2.  Some of the information I have looked at on the internet shows ranges as high as 40-50.  It was my understanding that a level of 10-20 is preferred.  What is correct?3.  Could the lack of estrogen or Vitamin D have contributed to what was going on?  If so, how?Thank you so much.","question"

Note though that this is just that: a trigger, not a guarantee it will result in a seizure, eg, likely during her 7day EEG there was some sleep deprivation asked of your daughter (to provoke an abnormal EEG) but just because she didn't experience an episode with the provocation doesn't mean her brain waves are behaving normally at the time of a seizure.  Of course, it may very well not be epilepsy, as you didn't describe her seizures (tonic-clonic, drop attack, etc--did anyone witness these events?) and could be isolated syncope events which are also not uncommon in adolescence, I passed out at 18 when I got a my ear pierced...  So, who knows.  Just wanted to give my experience with JME and EEG's.  I've had good neurologists and bad, informative and uninformative and its worth going to a couple-few to help put your mind to rest.  Be sure she mentions anything that may be neurological even if it seems unrelated.  Best of luck to both of you","answer"

Is this something I ask my neurologist to request or my primary care? I am on oral contraceptives for medicinal purposes (confirmed case of endometriosis and polycystic ovarian syndrome).  I started getting three painful periods a month once I started the Topamax and my doctor didn't relate the two until I did research online and found out that Topamax can essentially render the oral contraceptive ineffective.  The other thing I notice is that at night, I start to get this weird feeling headaches, pretty much on a regular basis.  I am not used to having them.  I believe I had an EKG in the ER within12-16 hours of the incident. Nothing significant was reported to me.   The only medication I was on at the time was the once daily oral contraceptive and zyrtec (for allergies).  I've also been speaking with someone I know whom is a chiropractor.  I remember that I had kidney stones for over a year and a half. ( I thought I had a UTI and the test was negative for UTI but high in calcium and so they sent me to the urologist who then through the tests found the kidney stones and my ovarian cysts.)   I was on special diets and lifestyle modifications and kept having to go to the urologist and follow up with my doctor over and over again, but I kept making more stones.  The chiropractor found out and gave me an adjustment once, and I never had another kidney stone to this day.  That was a few years ago.   So, at this point, I am going to cooperate with my neurologist and my primary care physician.  However, I am also going to see if I can alleviate some of the symptoms by having some chiropractic adjustments (in case a nerve or something is being pinched and causing me to have the symptoms I am having) and perhaps altering my diet (he says to eliminate gluten--but I really like food, so we will see how I do with that).  I'm having trouble because I don't like being on any medication at all.  If I need to be on one to prevent something like a seizure that will help to keep people safe while I am driving and such, then I will have no problem taking it, but if I don't need it, I would prefer not.  I appreciate the input.  Thank you very much everyone.","answer"

Apparently everyone has a seizure threshold and it just is a matter of what might trigger it. I was 35 when this happens. Unfortunately when you have one seizure you tolerance level is higher to having another. I lost my licence to, by law the doctor has to report it. They have to make sure your wife isn't going to have another. I now have to take a very low dosage of Topamax to make sure I won't have another one. It is one of the best meds with very little side effects. They also prescribe it to migraine sufferers, which I also used to get, which now I don't get so much with taking this so it has really helped me. Is your wife's dosage really high, I wouldn't think it would be after only one seizure mine isn't but then I am not doctor and I was told my catscan showed a gray area but I am not epileptic and am just really sensitive to medication and that is how my body reacted. I have also heard tell of a someone falling and two weeks later having a seizure because of it. Has she had an MRI done? You had mentioned a stroke so I was just wondering? When I was hospitalized with my seizure they gave me Advan and that stuff made me stupid and I couldn't remember anything for that entire week so I totally relate to your poor wife so sounds to me like that drug is not for her.  I had been seizure free for 5 years and unfortunately had one this past May because apparently your body can get used to your meds so I just needed a slight adjustment. So I only lost my licence for 3 months because it was considered a medication adjustment. It was a pain but I guess for the safety of others was needed.

She has a 15-month-old son (our grandson) who we are trying to protect from being put at risk in case she would have a seizure while she is alone with him. She has had 4 grand mal seizures in the past year - the last one just 4 months ago - and her original Neurologist told her in August that she should not live alone or drive for a minimum of 6 months. She agreed to leave the baby with us but opted to move into her own apartment in August. She has since then gotten a second opinion from another doctor who supposedly told her that she was fine and that her seizure was most likely caused by stress. She is now demanding that she be allowed to keep her son. Our son, the baby's father, passed away this past June and we offered to let her live with us after he died. However, she found it to be too confining and/or ""uncomfortable"" for her. We are trying to find an option other than filing for legal guardianship - but we are coming up empty. In the meantime, we are terrified about the safety of the baby. She is allowing him to stay with us during the day while she works, and she did just start a new full-time job as a home care nurse.  However, she is still insisting that she keep him at night - and she lives about 25 miles away from us. Her parents are elderly and not able to care for the baby although they live close to her. Her father is transporting her and the baby, although I think she has convinced him that it is safe for her to drive as well and I believe she is driving although the legal restriction in our state is that a person who has a seizure should not drive for at least 6 months. I hope someone here can help.","question"

We are not cruel people and we would never file for guardianship except as a last resort. There are other factors that I did not mention, but I will say that we believe our grandson's mother has psychological issues that need to be dealt with (her Dad and our son told us she was diagnosed as being Bipolar) - plus she has a history of abusing prescription pain medication and tranquilizers that was quite an issue before our son died. We know that she was under a lot of stress and we never expected for our son to die when he did. We have all been through more than we ever imagined we could handle but somehow, with God's help, we will find a way to keep going. When your children were babies, until they were old enough to talk and call for help if you had a seizure, did you have help with them? We never intended for her to live with us permanently but just until we could come up with a better solution. The Neurologist who had been treating her for over 3 years told her that it was not safe for her to live alone for a minimum of 6 months, which would also mean that it would not be safe for her to take care of her son without help either. We are trying to be fair, and we don't mean to seem thoughtless or unkind, but we are very concerned about the baby. Another thing I have wondered about is: how often do you need to have your med levels checked? She has another issue that complicates things even further -- she has had gastric bypass surgery, which she says affects how medication is absorbed. She seems to think she needs more -- for example, more pain medication -- than normal in order to have the same effect. She does seem to be able to eat a normal amount of food now since it has been several years since she had the surgery, so hopefully this is not as much of a factor. She has had a lot of trouble keeping a job since we have known her, and the job she has now seems to be temporary as well. We are paying for her health insurance through the state high risk pool and are also paying for the baby's health insurance. We are good people who love our grandson and are trying to protect him since our son is no longer here. He was very protective as well and would not let her drive since she started having seizures. I know how he would feel now and it makes things even more difficult. Bottom line -- we would never try to take a child away from his mother just because she has epilepsy. We are only trying to find a way to help her to protect him. Thank you so much for responding and please let me know if you have other suggestions.","answer"

When I was a kid I was diagnosed with siezures {they also said I had a left, frontal, cavernous angioma. I had two doctors. The brain surgeon said that caused the seizures, but the pediatric neurologist said the cavernous angima had nothing to do with the siezures}. I had no convulsions, but my eyes rolled back in my head for a couple seconds. Well, I was put on Zarontin and after a few years they ""weened"" me off it, and it seems that my seizures were gone. Later {when I was around 17 or 18 yrs old} I went back to get a 24 hr. EEG {because I was having dizzy spells}. Well, it said, though you couldnt see it by looking at me, I was having frequent seizures {by looking at me, you may think I'm having a day-dream}. They also had me close my eyes and flash light at me for a time, and yes, it gave me seizures. My doctor, however, put down that I my siezures had been resolved {and she never put me on anymore medication} I dont know why. Now, I am having severe dizzy spells {I've had them since youth, but they're getting more constant}. The room's not spinning or anything, but I'm really off balance. For a while it was constant, constant, constant. Now I have some breaks in between dizzy spells, but its still really bad. It was suggested to me that it may be diabetes, but when I wasnt feeling good I took my blood sugar and it was good.Any advice or insight would be appreciated. Because of this I probably wont be able to join the military like I planned, and now I'm thinking about becoming a police investigator in college, so I'm kindof obsessing over this, hoping I'll be able to do that. Not to mention I need a job, and I cant work with this dizziness. Thanks.PS. The medications I take mow are {not for seizures}: Metoprolol 100mg, Citalopram 20mg, Doxycycl 100mg.And they gave me Rugby Travel Sickness {with meclizine 25mg] for my dizziness but it did no good.

I got diagnosed with epilepsy as a child at 8 after having seizures. At first I just got diagnosed with confusional migraines ad then a few years later got the epilepsy diagnoses.. I tried a few meds early on with no luck just bad reactions. Then I went on depakote and have been on it ever since roughly 12 Years old when I started I would say.. I was seizure free for two years then when the doctors tries to take me off of it so see if I had outgrown it! I then had a seizure and went back on right after and have been taking it for 10+ Years now as I am now 25 and have not had 1 seizure since!!! I want to go off depakote as I want to have a baby, and I am scared of the long term aide effects. I want to go off the meds so badly but I am scared of the same result happening again only this time I am an adult who has a son,  works, and drives etc... Idk I am just very overwhelmed and scared etc.. Any advise would be great!!!! Thanks for taking the time to read my story","question"

It is very dangerous to stop medication on your own. If you feel that you may have outgrown your seizures, your doctor will recommend an eeg to see if you still have any seizure activity in your brain. If you do not have seizure activity then he/she can slowly take you off your meds while monitering you. If you do have seizure activity, then your doctor can make a medical suggestion to you. Epilepsy is hard to live with, I know but your doctor is your best resource. When I decided to have a baby I seen at least 3 different specialist to get their opinions. At that  time little was known about the meds I was on and pregnancy, but the medical knowledge on seizures has greatly advanced. We have been recognized finally. Good luck with everything and make good decisions when it comes to your epilepsy.PS My 25 yr old daughter is beautiful and her only problem is being spoiled.

We do take breaks every now and then. One night after we had played video games for a good amount of time, Alan went to shower and then came to bed. He was lying down and had a seizure. Then another one. He had a total of maybe 5 seizures and they were about 15 seconds long and a couple of minutes apart. Afterwards he was fine. He told me that he usually has a headache before a seizure and that he didn't this time. He also told me that he had taken an alka seltzer close to when he had taken his medication. He says that the aspirin in the alka seltzer caused him to have the seizure because it doesn't go well with his medication.

For me a key also is not so much searching for a cure as it is in preventing & avoiding things that trigger, set-off or contribute to the conditions. A condition that promotes migraine and/or deja vu for me is an ongoing lack of sleep followed by more than enough sleep. Within a day or two I will have a migraine or deja vu or both.For me, some foods set up a deja vu episode too. Nuts, like Hazel or Macadamias are a sure thing, not sure why.  Another odd thing that Doctors don't like because they don't ""get it"" is perfumes. I have severe perfume sensitivities that aggravates my asthma/COPD/pulmonary hypertension. I first experienced this when I was fourteen and trapped in the car on a family vacation. My stepmother had a new perfume, Nina Ricci. It was an * hour drive to Peoria, IL & 8 hours back. It was the 1970’s & I thought maybe it was LSD. I had no clue of what it was until a few years ago, at age 49. Besides avoiding triggers I have found that plain old dietary Magnesium supplements help me avoid these odd Deja Vu things as long as I follow my other self imposed guidelines. My Deja vu’s start with an amplified shiver starting in the mid abdomen that moves up rapidly. There is fear and euphoria and other emotions or feelings too all mixed together. Next a bit of dread or doom, then the Deja Vu feeling begins. At first it is almost humorous, kind of. Then full Deja Vu for about forty seconds. Lastly is the odd Migraine hangover and things don't ""look"" right for a while.","answer"

You probably felt so out of it because your brian was trying to get used to so much at once when you shouldn't have been taking it at all. That kind of fogginess is actually a normal (and very inconvenient) side effect when you begin taking any anti-convulsant.   The long term side effect associated with taking Trileptal is liver damage. It must be monitored and a blood panel must be taken on a regular basis to make sure your liver is OK. I don't think 5 days would cause liver damage though (since the damage is associated with a long term build up in your system). Are you pregnant? Trileptal should not be taken if you're pregnant. Other than that, you should feel normal after a couple days of stopping the medication. What a ridiculous mix up on the pharmacy's part. Sorry that happened to you.","answer"

This would usually appear in roughly the same place and would occur once every 10 - 30 minutes or so, lasting for 10 - 20 seconds approximately. This went on for a week or so, prompting me to see my GP, who diagnosed these as Migraine symptoms. He prescribed me some Paramax, which is essentially just a mixture of Paracetamol and something else that stops you from feeling sick.Anyway the lights continued every day until last Thursday, when I had just got into work. A colleague started talking to me, when suddenly this bright light filled my whole eye sight and I couldn't concentrate on what he was saying. After this, the next thing I remember is waking up on the floor with paramedics and my colleagues standing around me. Apparently I'd fallen, banged my head on the wall and had a fit on the floor. I was then taken to Hospital, given the usual tests and then sent home, being promised an appointment with the neurology department sometime in the next week.Unfortunately my body wouldn't wait for this. At 3am on Saturday morning, I had a fit in my sleep, prompting my family to once again call an Ambulance. I was very confused when I first woke up! This time in the Hospital I made it past the A&E department and was transferred to the Medical Assessment Unit, where a number of tests etc were carried out. This time things were happening for me. They eventually prescribed me some Sodium Valproate and told me to take one 200mg tablet twice per day.It's now two days later and Ive had no more fits. I'm still getting the light in my vision, although it has now moved to the right hand side of my vision. I'm now awaiting my appointment with the Neurology department.The thing that scares me most about this whole thing is losing my Driving License. My independence is everything to me.Anyone got any thoughts?Thanks.","question"

Except for the occasional cold, I'm healthy. 3 months ago I had my first seizure which resulted in a over night hospital stay...for observation. While there I had 2 more seizures. Spent 5 days there total.  After the second and third seizure they gave me a loading dose of Dilantin, Ativan to calm my seizures. Vancomycin for possible infection. Gave my to much Vancomycin and I had red man syndrome. Which then they had to give my Benadryl. Completely wiped me out and I was asleep for 3 days.  I had the usual run of tests all with normal results. Ruled out infection and illness as the cause of my seizures. Neurologist says I have Grand-Mal seizure, take my medicine (Keppra 1000mg), get plenty of sleep and no stress. Also says she can not rule out Epilepsy as the cause. Since then, I have done all of the above and have been seizure free. My biggest complaint is I would be very tired all the time. I could sleep about 12 hours a day. At first I was told this is normal and your body needs time to adjust to the medicine. So about a 6 weeks ago I started feeling back to normal.

What day is it? Do I have anything to do today? What am I doing tomorrow?"" This goes on for 2 mins and last night it was about 12 minutes...the longest ever.  She has had one EEG and CT scan.  Neither showed anything although as soon as we left from the EEG and got to the car and after 10 minutes she had another complex partial seizure.  Last night, she was scanning tv channels and she knew she should stop scanning because her head was feeling weird and then thee next thing she remembers was me at her bed and she didn't know how she got there---she had actually walk over to me, told me she didn't feel good and I took her to her room and she said she was wanted to lie down...so she did.  She is on Lamictal 75mg...low dose and was on Topamax prior but she was losing her short term memory on that.  I want to know from you, what test should I ask to have done because after 2 yrs I know there has got to be something more we can do in the test arena to narrow down her issues such as VEEG, MRI, PET Scan, MEG...these are the things I've read about and they should be available in the Phoenix AZ area.  What are the standard tests I should suggest and how do you suggest it in a positive and cooperative manner? I'm at loss for the next step but my daughter is in her last semester of college for Dietetic Technology at a community college and she wants to continue but I really want this control so she can have a better life because she is so extremely intelligent outside of this issue that began a couple years ago.  As a side note, she was 4 times low on estrogen, and 3 times lower than avg on progesterone and on testosterone.  She gets worse during the week before her period to the week after.  She is on the 3 month birth control as of last month to see if this helps. We are going to the endocrinologist in 2 weeks for the annual checkup and to retest the hormone levels etc.  Her brain is over active at night and she's on Lunesta as needed which seems to be every night. So in the meantime, are there brain related scans we can try to rule out or narrow down the part of the brain that is malfunctioning or over-excited?  Thank you...I don't know where to go with this.

I'm sorry its very hard to explain. and i almost vomited as well. i had a VERY strong feeling that i was going to. i felt like it was coming up but  i was holding it down. also i remember i had a little trouble breathing. then i remember my head started to tilt left. and i started walking into people. my friend around me said that my eyes were rolling back and i was sometimes jerking. i couldn't control what i was doing. i don't remember some of this. but i remember when it was happening, my memory was looping. it was like my mind was constantly refreshing, back to a certain point. so every 3-4 seconds i would think it was that point again, even though 10 minutes had passed. i had extreme difficulty talking as well. i couldn't form a sentence because my mind was looping. because of the 3-4 second mind refresh, i couldn't form a sentence because every 3-4 seconds i would have to start over from the beginning. my friends saw what was happening and got me out of the extremely cramped crowd. when i got out i was going back to normal. remember, all of this happened during my high of marijuana. i don't recall any foaming or anything. when i got out i got some food and water and i was just back to a normal high of marijuana.Please, did i have a seizure?

You may have had a seizure just from smoking drugs. But you'd better have it checked out to be sure. My 7.5 yr old son takes seizures and has a rare form of epilepsy. It is not a fun way to live your life. If you value your life at all, then you need to stop drinking and smoking all together. Go to school and become a doctor, lawyer, or whatever you want to be. Drugs will screw up your entire life. My little brother is a chronic druggie who has smoked since the age of 7 and now he is 28 yrs old and has nothing to speak for. He has never earned a honest cent in his entire life. I also have a uncle who has smoked for the past 40 years constantly and couldn't even be there when his wife died of cancer. He was apparently too busy smoking crack or something. If you want to do something with your life, start now!! You may be thinking "" oh, I can stop anytime, but honestly you can't.

They ran blood work, CT and EKG.... nothing abnormal in any of those except an 8mm pineal glad cyst on the CT scan although it was just an ""incidental note"" written down and the Dr.s don't seem to fret over it.... But in my opinion any cyst even if its small located in my brain is a big deal to me...... Now i feel like a lab rat because i decided to go both routes ER and through my pcp to be on the safe side... my pcp however was only able to give me a referral to see a neurologist and im in a bit of a spot tryin to locate one that takes my insurance. So i'm left with very little to go on :( To add to my frustration today i went in for a appointment that i scheduled with my pcp months ago for a RX refill i took copies from the ER tests so they could have it in my file. But some how in explaining again what happened now they want me to get an echo cardiogram. My heart is fine! and i don't understand all this need for tests that i honestly don't believe is related to the blacks and seizures! If the EKG they did was fine i'm pretty sure doing an ultra sound of my heart isn't going to show anything and my blood pressure has never shown signs of something wrong with my heart. It makes no sense....What i am more concerned about is this cyst they seem to think is fine..... something growing in the center of my brain taking up space would make sense as to why i might be having seizures, migranes, and muscle aches i've been on forums about this kind of cyst and everyone complains of the same problems i already deal with in addition to the blackouts that have been occurring..... but the main thing is that most of the people who have posted all say that the Dr.'s tell them that the cyst has nothing to do with the problems.... seems fishy to me if multiple people with the same cyst have the same problems. sounds to me like the Dr.'s don't fully understand this cyst at this point in time.... it says its found in 1-4% of ct and mri scans thats pretty small amount imo... but what do i know i am not a dr........ Hopefully when i talk to this neurologist i can get things straightened out and get to the bottom of all this *sigh* my anxiety problem i deal with isn't helpin me in the least i'm stressing over all this way to much because i already deal with enough health issues as it is and not knowin makes it even worse...... i will keep this updated as i find out more its good to know i can at least talk to some1 about it","answer"

They would be able to administer the test (Cat Scan and possible others) a lot sooner than your doctor’s office. Often this may require an overnight stay though. My mother suffer from hypoglycemia so they had to rule out diabetes with the fasting test where you drink the chalky liquid and come back in four hours for blood work. The attack you mentioned seems alot like the one I had on Wednesday. I was up with the family watching American Idol. I was enjoying Kiss playing with Adam Lambert and was enjoying a chew of Kodiak (the only bad habit I have). I began feeling nauseous and finished my chew. I got up and told the family goodnight and proceeded upstairs to bed. As I went up the stairs everything started spinning. I started hearing a buzzing in me ears which drowned out all sound. My legs collapsed and I fell against the wall. Luckily I was holding the hand rail and that was as far as I went. The spinning got worse, the noise got worse, and tunnel vision started to set in. I told myself that it would pass so I pulled myself up and went the remaining 10 feet to the bedroom and sat on the bed. Once there I laid back with a huge sigh and closed my eyes. I felt like the bed was spinning so I told myself I must have got up to soon. The next thing I remember my wife was standing over me asking me what I was doing and my oldest son was in the doorway. Apparently my son entered the room as soon as I laid back saw my arms shaking. He ran downstairs and told my wife to come upstairs. When she arrived I was coherent and respondent as soon as she shook me. Even though I was tired, I managed to get up and crawl into the bed. Then I realized I had lost bladder control again. (This is embracing.) The whole episode lasted less then 2 minutes. I attribute this to the Trileptal I take. So far it seems there is a lot of similarity between our episodes. Yours though sound like partial seizures where you do not lose full consciousness. With that being said, I would recommend you follow your current path and find out exactly what is going on.

(There are different types)  I have repeatedly had gran mal seizures and only once (at work) had a petite mal.  I must agree with the advice you have been given here.  While going to the Emergency Room is perhaps your first thought when you do not know what is happening with your child, since you have been told by a Physician to see a Neurologist - the ER is yes indeed just another bill.  I would suggest though that IF AND ONLY IF your son experiences any seizure which is not controlled after perhaps 5 minutes, then go to the ER.I was only taken to the ER when I had my first gran mal at work.  After that I was directed to a Neurologist and eventually we found a combination of pills which seem to be managing my seizure disorder.I must also agree with one of the other comments made here, Seizures must truly be a terrible thing for a child to experience.  Also for a parent to see.  (I was told that I experienced them as an infant & not again until in my 30's)  I have never actually seen a person having a seizure.So my dear - RUN, DO NOT WALK (well make an appointment) to whatever Medical facility you trust and request that your son be tested for a seizure disorder.  It will truly ease your mind (and help your son) to find out if this is the cause of the problems that he is experiencing.  And if this turns out not to be seizure related, get back to the original doctor and have her look for something else.My prayers go out to both of you   -   Anita","answer"

So if your son has one of these again, maybe you should try quizzing him to see if he knows names and things.  Also some people have warning signs before they have a seizure, letting them know that something is up.  So that maybe what your son's tummy aches are, his warning.  My dad rolls his eyes to the top of the lid, not all the way back but as far up as they can get without being rolled back.

Ask for the EEG Where you don't sleep for 24 hours and then you take the test. That way it is more likely for Epilepsy to show up on it. Epilepsy is not something doctors diagnose easily. It took months (and tons of tests) for me even to get a suggestion that I had epilepsy. Not all seizures are caused by epilepsy however. You may be having an allergic reaction or having a fever.

The following tests may be performed for the diagnosis of epilepsy: blood tests,  CT scan of the head or MRI of the head,  EEG or lumbar puncture. Depending on the type, there are medications that may be taken. You should observe and record any seizures to ensure the person gets proper treatment with medications prescribed by your doctor. Your initial efforts should be directed first at protecting the child from additionally injuring himself or herself. Help your child to lie down and remove glasses or other harmful objects in the area.  Do not try to put anything in the child's mouth and check  breathing is alright.  After the seizure ends, place the child on one side and stay with the child until he or she is fully awake.  Do not try to give food, liquid, or medications by mouth to a child who has just had a seizure. If the diagnosis is indeed a seizure, discuss the best treatment option for him. Regular intake of medication will help prevent recurrences. Take care and do keep us posted.","answer"

I told them I could not perform this maneuver and would seizure! They literally pushed me out of the vehicle!At this point in time I went down and my head flexed and reverberated on the cold concrete … as in my severe muscular contraction two grown men had let go of me!I told them again that I was now down and my head hurting from the impact and to take me back to the real hospital –they put me in the gurney and transported me finally without making me walk!All of these posts for weeks now have not gotten a single response!I knew I was in seizure territory and no one really believed me -- I will never forget that experience -- nor the lack of advice in this column for weeks -- as to what to do about it!My new neurologist (Doctor Jain) of Las Cruces is not available to give me alternative solutions to ""going down"" again -- I was on Tegretol when this happened!Finally, my PCP, Doctor Raquel Neeley of Las Cruces abandoned me yesterday when she would not facilitate re-admittance to the hospital or prescribe alternative meds – but could only say – “go see a psychiatrist.”I am waiting here patiently avoiding Tegretol and having a very hard time with a loud, color-saturated world that Mary describes and can’t see Doctor Jain until Monday!What am I missing here to get all of these posts examined and suggestions made?","question"

I, too, have epilepsy and have been on Lamictal for several years now. I have one healthy, thriving little boy who's almost 2 showing ZERO sides of any adverse reaction to Lamictal which I took while I was pregnant with him.I've been told by several neurologists (I was diagnosed when i was 13) that it's far safer to be on medication when you're pregnant versus not and risking your health thereby the health of your unborn baby. I've been told that of all anti-convulsants, Lamictal is the better drug to be on when pregnant. Aside from cleft-pallete, I haven't been warned of any other potential side effects. As the doctor mentioned, I was also told not to breastfeed. Another doctor told me that because the amount of medication the baby would get is so small, some do take the chance. I felt better to eer on the side of caution with that one, and most doctor's agree.It's really hard to stay positive when you research epilepsy and pregnancy online because everything makes you feel like it's all doom and gloom, like something will most definitely go wrong. Now I just try and keep in mind that all of these articles HAVE to tell you the things that could potentially go wrong. A medical article is never going to talk about all the possibilities of things being perfectly fine, given it's there to warn, not reassure you. While it's always best to be informed, I think you have to try to keep things in perspective and make sure your with an OB and a neurologist you really, really trust. I take 4mg's of Folic acid separate and apart from what's in a pre-natal vitamin and I also take Fish Oil tablets.My blood levels are taken monthly because the way Lamictal (or any medication) is absorbed in a woman's body esp. during pregnancy varies. I'm trying to be on as little as possible in this first tri-mester which for me is 500 mg's a day (2 in am, 3 in pm). Finding the right balance is relatively easy as long as you monitor it regularly.I'm sorry this has been such a long message! But I can completely understand your fears and hope this may help even a little.Take good care!","answer"

Lamictal or Lamotrigine is an anticonvulsant drug used in the treatment of epilepsy and bipolar disorder. Use during pregnancy is recommended only if benefits outweigh potential risks. Taking this drug during the first trimester of pregnancy may lead to abnormalities such as cleft palate in babies. It can also be found in breast milk. This is why breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment. Talk to your doctor about alternative medication if you want to be pregnant and continue with the treatment.

Doing some research on my own and comparing Lamictal with other anti-seizure meds, the side effects seem to be a bit less. I was on 400mg for a little while but started noticing some drastic side effects so I went down until I felt like I could function without my ""spells"" which was 100mg.

I have a client who is a nurse there who suggested I do so.  In 25 yrs has never seen the type of seizure my grandson had.  I was so impressed she responded quickly and told me what my grandson is having is NOT a seizure.  It mimic's one but it should not be classified as a seizure and that it is a shudder attack.  If they look like this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5erLHDX1h8&feature=channel_page  it may be the same thingthen you need to find a doctor who is familiar with these.  They are very different.  The Dr. at Childrens has given us a refferal of someone at UC Davis in Northern CA where my daughter is.  My grandson is having these about once a week.  Also my daughter found someone whose child was diagnosed with this also and hopefully will be seeing their doctor as well. I work in acadamia and Dr.'s at Universities are studying the latest and greatest on medical advancements.  Find a Dr. that is teaching at your best Medical School and make an appointment. Especially if all your child's developmental growth is average.  One thing that surprises me is that so far no ones doctors have tested these children for food allergies.   I have a co-worker who has seizures from fresh tomatoes...who would of thought of  that and it was something that developed as an adult in her 50's.  It took a year before they figured out her cause..actually it was her husband.  No one ever asked what she had eaten but he started to notice that she had had them every time. My brother has had epilepsy for 40 yrs and before a Dr pegs you into this diagnosis you need to be sure.  So I have been around seizures since the day I was born and I am 49 and seen many different types and I was certain this was a type that I just hadn't seen.  I was wrong and so were the 4 doctors he has seen in just 2 weeks.  Its not to be taken lightly and it is very scary especially when we find nothing in traditional testing that gives answers.  There someday will be a test to tell us what seizures with normal EEG readings mean but they have to be testing for the right diagnosis.  My daughter had a tumor in her spinal cord.  They tested her for so many things and couldn't figure out what was wrong.  Then they prescibed treatment.  I rejected it because I told them how can you treat something you don't know what it is?  Finally weeks later a different Dr order the correct test....it was obvious what was causing her pain.  Had I taken the first treatment she could have been paralized for life. So I probably am a bit more cautious to accepted default diagnosis because of my personal experience.  After 3 kids and now a grandson I have chalked up a few :)","answer"

Many things can cause you to go unconscious not just seizures. Just because you were likely to have them as a young adult doesn't necessarly mean you will have them later. You need to be completely honest and recall everything you can about the evening which will be helpful to the doctor. I am sure you don't recall but maybe someone you know might know.

"Can you contact this women?","https://www.medhelp.org/posts/Epilepsy/Can-you-contact-this-women/show/776254","peanuttt","2009-03-03T10:37:55-05:00","I do not have anyway of knowing when this particular post was made, but I hope and pray that somehow the women that made it will see this and contact me. (A long shot, to be sure, but I am desperate) It was a very long, about 3 pages, description of a women, in her 30s, having certain unexplained symptoms that appeared to be either epilepsy or schizophrenia. The doctor from the Cleveland Clinic suggested she go to an academic, or learning type institute of medicine, for her problem. The question title was: Epilepsy & Schizophrenia and the forum was: Neurology Forum and the topic was: Epilepsy. I located it for the second time by typing: ""For the last 10 years episodic lapses"" into the Google search. If anyone wants to take the time to help me find her, this is how you could locate her article. Her symptoms are almost identical to mine. Reading her article was almost (except for the Dad with schizophrenia) as if I had written it about me. I couldn't believe it!! I have tried so hard to explain these things to doctors, but they seem to be just guessing. My seizures (don't ask me what kind they are because I don't think my neuro, that I have had for the last 5 years, has ever told me, exactly). I have had, as she had, a closed head injury to the left temporal lobe when I was 22, I am now 52 and the seizures started about 6 years ago. I have my ""seizures"", aphasia type episodes, anywhere from 3 to 15 times a day. Sometimes they are only minor disruptions, other times they can bring me to my knees. If you find her article she explains this very well, much better then I can. The Lamictal, 425mg. per day and Lexpro 20mg. did nothing to stop them. So, because I felt the drs, WERE so vague, I stopped taking both meds. over a 1 1/2 year period. Then about 4 months later I had my first grand mal seizure, complete with a badly bitten tongue, stopped breathing for so long that my, normally calm husband, performed cpr on me, and I was taken to hospital. I can remember only bits and pieces of that night but I can tell you it was a horrifying experience. Waking up with my 17yr. old son putting pants on me to go to the hospital, EMCs and police standing around my bed, and having absolutely no idea what had happened. The next day I was tired and confused. Saw my doctor, she acted like a nut and told me to go see a psychiatrist. GREAT!! Now I am on 300mg. Dilantin and feel like my life is over.Please find her article for me, read it and let me know what you think. I guess 2 people can have the exact symptoms of this ""whatever it is"" and be nuts, but I really would like to know what she did to get answers and what finally happened to her. It is horrific just zoning out like this and no one can really tell you why or make it stop. Because of these episodes, and my memory being so bad, I cannot work and this makes me feel worthless. You have no idea!! The Dilantin does not affect these D**n things either. The seizures come on strong if I try to exercize (can't spell that word to save my life) so the weight is making me depressed.  Help me please, if you can.Also, I finally know what the aura episodes are, jamais vus. Thanks to her! I keep telling the drs. they are not deja vus, but they don't what to hear that. I do not have visual hallucinations, as she does, but almost word for word on her post is me!! GOD! This is great news for me!! Misery loves company, and all that, you know.If there are 2 of us, there has got to be others out there like us. Tell us if you will. You can email me directly, if this is allowed. If one of the drs, tells me this is okay, I will post again with my email so you can. Don't be afraid. If this is psychological, or whatever, we need to know,. I NEED to know!! I hate these meds!!Please, help save a life that was worth saving before this nightmare began!Peanuttt","question"

I had it surgically removed but the siezures have only become worse and continue to get worse day by day.I used to be able to go a few months without having one but now they seem to be happening every couple of days.They have interfered with all of my personal relationships because of the mood changes.My short term memory is shot.I live alone and this can be very scary, you go to bed like normal and wake up on the floor,covered in bruises with blood all over your pajamas from where you have bitten your tongue.Sometimes i get rug burn on the side of my face and the disorientation can last for days.Most of the people that are close to me can tell if I have had a siezure even if they didnt witness it just by the changes in my behavior.It has also effected my work, i cant keep a job because i cant seem to get through the orientation period without having a siezure and it shows in the quality of my documentation.I have also had to go through the embarrassment of having my children find me 1/2 naked on the floor going through a siezure.And the horror of being in a normal environment...just standing there chatting with others, then wake up on the floor surrounded by paramedics and people crying.Please purchase yourself a medalert necklace or bracelet that lists your medical diagnosis, meds you take and any allergies.This is for your safety, because as you know, you never know when one of these may hit.","answer"

I had lost conciouness and fell back in the chair with my eyes rolled back for several minutes(2-3). I was very tired afterward. I had an EEG done that came up abnormal in my right temporal lobe. This has only happened to me a couple more times since. Once while a nurse was taking my vitals, he said he didnt know what had happened but my oxygen level dropped and my pulse went up. Most often I have times where either I have trouble comprehending what others are saying to me or I have visual distortions(such as a door seeming odd(closer or larger) and the floor or walls seem to pulse or look like they are moving kind of like water). After these spells I have a persistent headache(more of a constant pain) on my right side. I've seen several neurologists had another eeg that came out normal as well as an MRI that was normal. I've had the drs talk to me as if I was faking what was happening. My mother has temporal lobe epilepsy(many siezures a day) on the left side i believe which came on when she was the same age as i was(19).

When you lie down, the blood return from the legs to the heart becomes easy. And the heart needs more power to push blood to the lower limbs. The kind of pain you have could mean ischemic cause. Ischemia is a reduction of blood supply. I guess if you lower you legs from the bed for some time, the pain will reduce a bit, or may even vanish. You will need to check the blood circulation in the lower limbs. The best method is the DSA (digital subtraction angiography), but I am not sure if it is possible especially when you don't have the insurance. Regards","answer"

I have not noticed a change in color of my legs but then again it happens only in the evening when I am in bed, it does not hurt until I am in the bed for about an hour or so, that is when it starts and it is beginning to get to me mentally, physically, and emotionally. I take several medications. Alproic acid 1000 mg. 2 a day and 2 in the evening, Lorazapam 1 mg. 3 times in the evening and hydroxazine 25 mg, 2 every evening.

During my seizures my facial expressions depicted very odd smiles with a fearful gaze & raised eyebrows. I also had a tendency to giggle uncontrollably which is probably why many people mistook it for a manic episode. I could not control my balance & my arms & legs always shook during the aftermath.

The thing is is i had found it difficult and still do find it difficult to cope with at time.. even after i have been off medications since 2006/07.I must admit that one must be careful in what practice/profession you would like to do as it is a good idea to think about what could happen to you if you might have a seizure in a kitchen... hot oils and frying pans ect.Though dont let that stop you if thats something you really want to do. or maybe you can do something that is close to being a cook?I did find it difficult getting jobs as the meds that i used to take always made me ""out of it"" or ""apear as if im some sort of drug pusher or something""Dont give up hope though.. I actually believe that there are other things besides or along with medications that can help.. like ciropractic therapy which i believe had a helping hand in stopping my siezure.Do you have something else you like to do maybe? in the end it is up to you if you want to finish the course.. because you know what you can and cant do and if you are prepared for that proffession then you can still become one of the best in the field..IE, would be to only use what you need at the time and dont leave things laying around that might hurt you, thats if you do end up having a siezure ect ect ect....hope that helps somewhat","answer"

As at 69 1/2 I went through the fact that people believed epilepsy was contagious, or that you were inhibited by the devil during the 1930-1940 period of time."" Seldom did they want anything to do with you, teachers in school doubted your capabilities and often put you at the front of the class to keep an eye on you (that was very depressing), employers also doubted one abilities in that ""they were always thinking that you had to do the simplest job, so as to be in a safe place; should a seizure occur.""Well, over the years with further knowledge and especially disability issues ""employers for the most part nowadays are willing to give you a chance to prove your abilities in the job they assign you.""A lot has had to do with progress in medicine; while the other has been largely affective due to Human Rights of people with Disabilities and The Americans with Disabilities Act. I was fortunate to serve on the Employer Committee of The Presidents Committee on Employment of People with Disabilities for 3 1/2 years while I was employed at Honeywell in Minnesota. We, on that committee met with big business, small business, unions and people, to aquaint them with the reality that ""a person with a disability often returned to their employer 100%+ in effort, attendance, and integrity.""On the other hand, people who don't understand disability often judge one with it only through the speculation they see, not the reality of the whole matter; until they or a loved one become confronted with one.We often said to people ""you can't understand having and living with a disability unless you have one!""  You are a person and capable at doing what you can to the best of your ability in any area of life that you desire to pursue, because epilepsy is only temporary regarding its time of occurence; the rest of the time is yours to do.If I can help you understand any of tehe things further, I'd be glad too, as I've also had Human Rights Commission and Epilepsy Foundation experience.web: ***@****Sincerely, Kay Kramer","answer"

The main component of Trileptal is Oxcarbazepine, indicated in the treatment of partial and generalized toni-clonic seizures, just like in your case. It can be used alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs. If you are using this alone, usually, therapy is initiated in 2 divided doses and may be increases depending on the response of the patient. However, as with all antiepileptic drugs, it should be taken regularly or as prescribed by your doctor, since if it is not, and you forgot and withdrew from the drug abruptly, the potential of increased seizure frequency happens. More information about Trileptal can be found in this link: http://www.mims.com/Page.aspx?menuid=mng&brief=false#ContraindicationsSometimes, it is also important to note the special triggers that cause unexpected seizures. And the most frequent cause is also failure to take the medication as prescribed. Other causes are lack of sleep, illness or fever, or use of alcohol or some drugs. To know more about these special triggers, you may visit this link: http://www.epilepsyfoundation.org/about/quickstart/newlydiagnosed/qsliving/idvseizuretrigs.cfm	It is important to visit your doctor so that he may adjust your medications or may do some tests like EEG to see whether there are any irregularities in your brain’s electrical activity that may produce the increasing seizures or even brain scan to see the scar tissue.I hope this can help.

There is a woman who is diabetic and we all know the symptoms incase something happens, because it has before. We're always there for her and buy her a drink or snack if it'll help her.

She might just be extremely overwhelmed which is worsening the seizures. That's what does it for me. Didn't she have an EEG that showed she was having seizures? Before I was diagnosed with epilepsy they thought I might have a mood disorder but my seizures weren't that obvious so it was harder to diagnose. I was about 15 at the time and am almost 20 now. It was the EEG that finally made the peices fall together and I'm better now. Maybe you should get a second opinion. Personally, I think that walking away from a child when s/he is having a seizure would just increase anxiety and make seizures worse. She'd probably feel more ashamed,  I know it's difficult especially at this age. At least that's how I'd feel.Possibly try a neuropsychologist. I've never been but I'm thinking that maybe the doctor could give more insight into exactly how the anxiety may be affecting her seizures and how to cope with both. I believe that there are other places for teens to talk about their experience with epilepsy. I think on the epilepsyfoundation.com there is a section for teen forums but I'm not 100% on that. Hope everything works out ok, good luck!","answer"

I have one for you!!I took my son to an e.r. because he had 4 seizures in a day and 1/2. Not like any other that he has. At this point he had not been dia. with anything. His symptoms are more like a book. I won't go into detail...long story short... I'm over reacting he is not having real seizures they are Psychogenic Seizures and he needs mental help. There was activity on the eeg but not epilepsy. He had another one in front of the dr and he said that he made his self.  Very rude Dr. that had no interest in his history or med records. Didn't even ask to see them. Nor wolud they admit him to observe what was going on.

Now, as far as EEGs I've been told that when there is a spike in brain activity, as long as the spike lasts for less than 3 seconds its considered to be in the ""normal"" range. I had a 24 hour EEG and my spikes were just under 3 seconds, technically ""normal"" but a little borderline, but my doctor said that as long as I feel fine then I should be ok. (Why take a higher dose if it's not needed). I had a friend who had several EEGs but she was on the borderline normal range and the seizures stopped after being medicated. It took her years.Also, what brings on the seizures? I know there are a lot of triggers and different people react differently to them. I didn't realize some of the things then but they make sense now. I couldn't watch movies because the light bothered me, I couldn't drink coffee because the caffeine was too much, hormone levels, never slept well, stress etc. Maybe recording things like that can make it easier to handle and diagnose. I just tended to avoid certain things not exactly realizing why, but it helped me. Listen to your body, it does things for a reason.Have you had any head injuries in the past? I believe that can bring on seizures.How long has this happened? You're whole life or just recently? I developed epilepsy later in life, around puberty. I have juvenile myoclonic, my seizures worsened as the years went by. If your still feeling crappy on the meds, try switching to something else. I'm on Lamictal and I feel great. I don't know about the others, but Lamictal can be used as a mood stabilizer. I used to have bad anxiety and stuff too. Either way, whatever meds you take you should take folic acid. Doctors can prescribe 1 mg or so for you. Just because a lot of epilepsy meds can cause birth defects, just incase you end up with a bun in the oven.Make sure your primary refers you to a neurologist. I write a lot, sorry this is so long!

It isn't brain damage, it isn't a tumor, they don't SEE anything that makes your seizure activity obvious to them. Although it's not a good answer as to why, it's good news for you. It's likely you could outgrown having seizures.  I had my first seizure in my early 20s. My neurologist told me that when you think about a person developing into an adult, you think about 13-16 years of age. You grow, you're done, you're an adult . When your body stops changing your brain many times hasn't started. The process of puberty in your brain often goes to your mid to late 20s. Many people have seizures when they're young and simply outgrow it. Everytime you have a seizure your brain make you a little more susceptible to having another. You want to take your medication for at least 2 years to make sure your brain has plenty of time to heal before trying to go without it. Dilatin is usually a pretty good medication with few side effects. Did the anxiety and migraines come on after you started Dilatin? If so, you should talk to your Dr about switching meds. There's no reason to live with bad side effects. There are some other seizure medications on the market that actually help anxiety and migraines. Topamax and Lamictal come to mind off hand. There are many options out there for things that would work and help you feel better.","answer"

Each time she has had her episodes we rush her to emergency. The last episode she had (August 2008) the ER had her hooked up to a heart monitor and noticed that in the last seizure (had 8 all together that day) her heart rate dropped down to about 20-30bpm.

She is currently on Epilim.My question is: Does anyone else suffering from Epilepsy have problems with their heart rate when they have a seizure?Her doctors are trying to work out three things that might trigger it...Her heart making her seize and vomit, or vomitting causing her to seize and heart rate to drop or if the seizures are causing her to vomit and heart rate to drop.","question"

First let me apoligize for my spelling its horible! did I spell that right? Anyway I am a 33y f was diagnosed last year with complex partial seizers. With my seizures my heart rate drops too. With my last seizure it droped to 35bpm. At first they did not know that, it took about 6 mths of testing to get all of this figured out. we went round and round with the drs about it They cardo doc put me on a heart monitor for about a week,would have been longer but I had a seizer and that was when we found the drop. So we still went back and forth about what was causing it, I would get dizzy, thats the best way to explain it, feel really nausios, and just pass out. I never actually vomitted though. But just like you said what came first the chicken or the egg? First of all they wanted to put in a pace maker, and I fought that, i did not want that at my age, so I had a tilt table test done which was very unplesent but it did show signs of a cardio problem. But the key with that is that it was actually a dehydration problem. I can not hold my salt/sodium. The trigger for the drop in heart rate was the seizures. but with more sodium in my system I don't have the drop in my bpm. The medical name is ""ictal bradycardia syndrom"" there are a few forms but it's not common. ictal just means the seizure itself and the bradycardia is the slow heart rate. So with a change in diet, and my seizure meds I have not had any problems since Oct. 5 2007. You are the mom you know your child don't give up untill your satisfied with the answers you get.

In children with absence seizures due to secondary generalized epilepsies, death is related to the underlying disease.

I was also having some memory issues, such as mixing up words and not being able to retrieve words when speaking.  I have a master's degree, and I'm a teacher, so as you can imagine this was quite embarrasing to not be able to use common vocabulary words correctly.  I would also mix up the beginning sounds of words, for example substituting ""store"" for ""sore"" and so on.   I went to a neurologist and had MRI, EEG, bloodwork, and neuropsychological testing done.  Dr. says EEG had focal abnormalities in the temperal lobe, specifically that in the left temperal lobe there was ""one sharp tracing"".  My first question is, what exactly does that mean? I had been on Tegretol for almost 2 years for bipolar disorder.  There is a dispute among several different doctors of mine about whether or not I am actually bipolar.  I personally don't think so for many reasons, but to make a long story short, once the staring spells became noticable, they increased the dosage of Tegretol to 3 times a day since it is also used as an anticonvulsant.  The day after the increase, I had what think may have been a drop seizure.  I slumped over on the couch.  My eyes started watering uncontrolably.  My boyfriend was saying my name and smacking me in the face.  I could see him and hear him, but I could not speak and lost complete motor control.  I did not have convulsions, but rather just could not move.  He said my pupils were huge and eyes moving rapidly.  I was scared but could not voice it.  I came out of it after a few minutes and was extremely tired. Tried to go to work the next morning and my boss sent me home.  I tried calling the dr. and then I slept for 6 hours more.  Dr. called back and he didn't make a big deal out of it, which seemed strange to me.  I have been reading a lot online.  Does this sound like simple partial seizures?  What can anyone tell me about what is going on with me?  Also, should I be getting a 2nd opinion? A few weeks later, I suddenly received frantic calls from the dr's office.  The girl from the office said dr. is ordering me not to drive under any circumstances and changed Tegretol to Carbatrol.  Now that I am on Carbatrol, I feel very tired.  I also started mentruating about 5 days earlier than I would have normally.  The side effects mentioned calf pain....my muscles in my thighs are sore, and slightly in my calf, but more so in the thigh.  Is this normal? Anyway, I would appreciate any input or advice from doctors or anyone who has experience similar symptoms or experiences. Thank you!","answer"

When I went back to my regular drs at the VA, as I am a veteran, they sent me to Neuro.  I began suffering debilitating migraines as well from that ordeal.  They did another MRI.  They (VA neuros) diagnosed me with a seizure disorder.  To treat me, they gave me topamax.  That has helped with the seizures and the migraines.  I occasionally get breakthrough migraines.  They had to adjust the topamax a few times though.  However over the past 3 years, I have also suffered from stomach palpatations, and I'd get really flush and I'd sweat.  And I can't breathe.  I also get tingling and numb in my hands and fingers.  My primary care drs have told me its anxiety.  I told them no its not.

An MRI or EEG would typically show which type of seizures you are having based on where the activity is in your brain. It does sound to me like you are experiencing anxiety which could also be a side effect of the Topamax. When you take drugs that effect the brain, any number of side effects can occur. How long have you been taking Topamax? Did you also experience the finger tingling and numbness on depakope? Do you have high blood pressure? Are you drinking plenty of water and taking daily vitamins? In someone who had a mini stroke it's pretty important to drink water instead of caffeine. It does sound like you have some problems that are making your life uncomfortable, but from an amateur's prospective I would suspect the Topamax before partial seizures. Partial seizures are typically caused by having a difficult birth (your own, not your child's). My sister didn't breathe for 15 minutes after being born and has partial seizures. If you were having partial seizures you would not be able to describe what happened during the event. You would not remember. Yes, you would also have your license revoked again if they discovered you were having seizures while medicated.","answer"

Indeed, hives could be due to a lot of causes including medications, foods, pollen, animal dander, latex, and insect stings. Physical factors or environmental factors can also result in the release of histamine such as heat, cold, sunlight, water, pressure on the skin, emotional stress and exercise. Hives are triggered when certain cells (mast cells) release histamine and other chemicals into the skin.   In planning to switch to another medication, discuss this first with your doctor for tapering and determine which drug is well suited for you. It is not  advisable to discontinue the present drug abruptly since this can lead to more seizures. Take care and keep us posted.","answer"

However, The risk that a person will suffer this condition becomes progressively lower as time passes after the injury but may still be at risk over 15 years after the injury. To some, not all seizures that occur after trauma are post traumatic seizure; they may be due to a seizure disorder that already existed.I would highly recommend that you have this evaluated further for proper management.  Neurological examinations and other tests may be done.  Take care and regards.","answer"

If you have never had a seizure you will not have one from an anticonvulsant. You just won't. Even coming off it will not bring on a seizure. It says that on every website and warning label because epileptics (according to my Dr) are notorious for deciding to just stop taking their meds or skipping doses to avoid side effects. THAT's why it says you may have a seizure. Most people taking it have seizures. They shouldn't stop or the seizures will come back. Taking it for other reasons will not cause a seizure. It's impossible.My guess is that it was too low of a dose to help with your anxiety. If it stresses you out though, you probably just need something different. Are you taking any other meds for your anxiety? Make sure to get a good vitamin until you can talk to your Dr. Sometimes getting enough vitamin B in your system will help relax you a bit. Good luck.

I'll also drop things like I've touched something hot, and my mind is usually going at lightspeed. Things that provoke an attack are multitasking, eating or drinking anything sweet and of course stressfull thoughts or emotions.Thanks for the feedback. This is the first time I have heard that Dilantin is depleted by stress - it makes perfect sense. My neuro has asked me to slow down and even try meditation. Have a super stressful job, and long hours with weekly travel. Hard to find time to meditate when you have 15-18 hour days everyday.I'm glad to hear you're seeing a new neuro. Let him/her know the big picture and all the emotional/psychological issues and how its impacting your life. I usually take a notebook with my thoughts and symptoms written down and read from it. It makes them take me more seriously and they are less likely to rush through the appointment.Try to take it easy - ha - so easy to preach to others! I'm going to try and keep stress levels down as well. BTW, ask if you should take a bone density test, MRI to check Cerebellum, and short term memory loss. I had these done. I'm a 45 yo male, with positives on bone loss and shrinkage of Cerebellum. We're still watching the memory loss thing. Current neuro says stress is a factor. Ha. When they're at a complete loss of diagnosis they say one of 3 things: Virus, Stress or Idiopathic!

I've been on Dilantin for about 30 years, also started at 13 yo. and was on 400mg @ night.I went through the same issue a few years ago and the seizures suddenly began 20 mins after I got out of the car after a 3 hour drive. I tried several and none seemed to work for me. I tried Sodium Valproate, Tegretol and Topamax, but NONE of them worked as well as Dilantin. So they had me up to 800 mg of Dilantin and slowly brought me down to 500mg.It's very very important to find a good neuro who can analyze and understand your EEG. Topomax is one of the newer drugs with fewer side effects, if it works for you.I went through 9 neuro's before I found one who would not try to do dosaging over the phone!!! So not sure if I answered your q...I wanted to switch, but nothing else works. Long term effects of Dilantin are not good. At 45 I have osteoporosis, possible shrinkage of the cerebellum, some balance issues (which is controlled by Cerebellum) and experiencing memory loss - we're still trying to figure out if this is stress or side effects of Dilantin.Please speak to your neuro about the long term effects of Dilantin - these are all well known and documented. Hang in there and hope things work out for you. Keep me posted.Best wishes Toby","answer"

I am 49 and finally went to a neurologist . Was always told by GP's that it was nerves. I wanted to explain to the sleep specialist/neuro what exactly I do when falling asleep but he gave me a fast touch your nose with your finger exam and didn't really care much what my symptoms were. He said lets get a eeg and then a sleep study and we'll find out. Well I had a very young kid for the tech who said he really wanted to be a cop do the test. It was freezing in the room but he said must keep it cold so I don't sweat and electrodes fall off. In the short time I did sleep he said he has on camera my arousals. He said ""maybe you have sleep walking"".Went to neuro for results. He said no sleep apnea and heres some Klonopin and cymbalta. No explaination at all. He then said you have some type of parasomnyn. I said I know I do not sleepwalk so Dr. maybe nocturnal panic attacks. He said no because you have it all night. I had to pull words out of him. I said is it possible that it is nocturnal seizures. he said no because your awake eeg was normal and seizures last much longer . So I walked out to the car and started to cry. I did not take the klonopin because I do not want to take a medication when I don't even know what I'm taking it for. I called him back 2 weeks later because I was getting no sleep. He was nasty on the phone and said I don't know what you have but I told you to take the klonopin. You do not have sleep apnea and I cannot make something up. I thought the whole idea is to at least try to tell me why I'm taking the klonopin.I fall asleep okay and then within about 20 minutes I jolt up, feel it coming on, grasp all the covers tight so I don't fly out of bed and everything starts tensing in my muscles. Then I let out a big exhale and it's over till another couple of minutes and it starts again. Over and over all night long. I don't know if Im tensing my legs and arms on purpose so I don't end up on the floor or it's involuntary. I also sometimes kick the furniture. I am aware of whats going on. the feeling usually starts in my stomachlike a tension and then it all comes on me.I looked up nocturnal panic attacks and it mostly said it happens once a night. I have this over and over and over all night long. Should I see another neuro. It seems that the sleep study was only geared to check sleep apnea and he never even considered seizures. Thank you all for any advice.__________________","question"

When I have one I am wiped out for days. I feel like I got hit by a train and cannot remember anything that happened for about a week prior. I have a very hard time waking up after a seizure and cannot understand what's going on around me for several hours. I also need a lot of sleep for days afterwards. I also had nighttime anxiety after my daughter was born for about 2 years. Like you I would jolt awake almost like I was scared awake. My heart would race and I'd lay awake for hours trying to fall back to sleep. (I have wondered if I have some sort of sleep problem since I had both nocturnal seizures and nighttime anxiety.) My guess based on your description of your symptoms is nighttime anxiety or panic attacks. You should try the klonopin. If you can get a good night sleep you'll probably feel really good and less likely to have problems the next night. Do you snore? I am seeing an expert in nocturnal seizures right now. He is in MN if you're interested in a referral.Another thing I should probably let you know is many epilepsy medications are used for both symptoms of epilepsy and anxiety, psychotic disorders or bipolar disorder. They kind of work the same way to settle your brain and get things working properly. I'd give the medication a chance if you're willing. The neurologist is probably trying to treat your symptoms with medications that commonly work for those types of symptoms. It sounds like he has a terrible bedside manner though and didn't explain things well at all. You might want to find another Dr that explains things better and makes you feel like he's taking your problem seriously.","answer"

I went to 9 different neuro's until I found my current one. The others were trying to see as many patients as possible so giving no more than 3 or 4 mins during appointments. I took the bull by the horns and started interviewing the neuros during my first visit - explaining my needs and concerns. Several did well for a few appointments, then tried dosaging over the phone or deferring to their nurses. It took months to get the seizures under control but I was willing to see neuro's who were several hours drive from me if the one's in town couldn't give me the time of day.This is far too important to be treated like a primary care physician treating a patient with the common cold or flu. From my perspective, nuero's have become very lax except for emergencies and catastrophic issues. The moment you go into ""maintenance"" mode, they tend to pull back. It's vital that you find a neuro who will be responsive and answer all your questions in layman's terms, explore all solutions collaboratively and TAKE THEIR TIME during office visits. To me a neuro rushing through the appointment or being dismissive are major red flags to look for a new doctor. I understand that they have 100's of patients blah blah blah, but in our work we all have similar pressures - but one cannot compromise on major issues....treating a seizure disorder is a major issue.

Studies show that the risk is  less than 5% if either parent has epilepsy. If both parents have epilepsy, the risk is a bit higher. It is good to know that most children will not inherit epilepsy from a parent, but the chance of inheriting epilepsy is higher for some types. Epilepsy in which the seizures begin from both sides of the brain at the same time or primary generalized epilepsy is more likely to involve genetic factors than partial epilepsy, in which the seizures arise from a limited area of the brain.

He woke up that morning with a severe head ache that lasted for a long time (Tylenol would not ease the pain). The seizure occured 30 minutes after taking 1 dose of Omnicef 250 MG that was prescribed by his DR. for an ear infection that day. An ""MRI"" was performed the next day as well as blood work drawn. The blood work came back indicating that he had lyme disease (one of the tests was the western blot test and also band 41 tested positive). He is currently on Ceftin 250 mg 2 x daily for 20 days for the lyme. They will retest his blood in a few days.MRI Impression: Hyperintensitites of the peritrigonal deep white matter and of the superior frontal gyri greater on the left. These are overall, non specific. Considerations for dysmyelinating etiology such as adrenoleukodystrophy should be considered as well as lyme disease, and multiple sclerosis and potentially secondary demyelinating disease. Pediatric neurological consult is suggested. The following week a child neurologist performed an ""EEG test"" on my son and the results came back:""Abnormal""slow frequency on right sidesharp/ slow waves in the same locationepileptic tendencies shownMore seizures may occurThe DR. that called with the results said that they did not prescribe anti-seizure meds for a child that has only had 1 seizure.We have an appt the end of next week with a physican assistant at the neurologist office to discuss his test results.Of course, I have many questions and wanted to know if any of you have expertise in EEG results?My son continues to have head aches that will bring him to tears (this is not a boy that cries easily). The head aches are usually in very specific spots and tend to occur when he is tired or stressed. Also, he has never complained of head aches in the past. These only started the morning his seizure occured.","question"

I just posted about my daughter. She has not had a seizure, that I know, of but here are her EEG results, was told they were ""abnormal"" too. Some background, she hasDown syndrome and Autism. The report shows the following:The patient's icteric awake background showed rhythmic 7 to 8 hertz orslightly past 8 hertz, occipital back with occasional sharp waves indrowsy and awake states over the biparietal and posterior temporalregions, next, on the right more than the left.These were sometimessynchronous and occasionally asynchronous over the right hemisphere.With sleep, they became more active. Examples of the drowsy awakestate were seen at 17:12:50. Good examples of sleep and drowsy sharpwaves predominately over the right hemisphere were seen at 22:35:16and at 22:35:18. These were seen in a fairly frequent semi consciousfashion at Stage II sleep and also Stage III sleep. Rhythmic runs ofthis activity that were synchronous in both the parietal regions butsometimes higher amplitude and more seen over the right hemisphere wasseen at 17:17:56 and 17:17:59. This activity is fairly frequentthroughout all portions of the sleeping record.The 24 hour EEG showed sharp waves over the right and left parietaland posterior temporal regions with predominant maximal activity overthe right posterior quadrant with the right parietal leads being inthe maximal areas of sharp waves. This activity was seen most ictal inStage II and Stage III; less frequently in drowsiness and awake state.This activity did not correlate with any clinicial behavioral changeto suggest a patten is present in sleep predominately.What is interesting is, they put her on Depakote, which I understand to be anti-seizure medicine and I don't think she's had a seizure. But it could be different due to the Down syndrome and Autism. Have you found out anything else????Megan","answer"

She has developed a severe phycosis and has gone from being a registered nurse,single mom and purchasing her own home to being a patient in a phychiatric hospital. I have written senators, congressmen, President Bush and Vice President Chaney and have been involved in a heated cyberspace exchange with Bonnie Alderton of the FDA to demand that this device be removed from the public market. The Supreme Court made a decision called ""Riegel v. Medtronics"" that would not allow companies to be sued who obtained PMA {pre-market-approval} for their medical devices. In July a bill was submitted before Congress to reverse this decision. This can be a lengthly process since it would have to be then sent through the House, Senate and then approved by the President. This bill needs to go through!! Anybody who has had any medical devices implanted that have proved to be sub-standard and faulty needs to contact their Congressmen and Senators and the White House. Look up the surgery you had done on the computer and type in ""Have there been any fatalities or serious injuries reported due to this surgery"" and I sure hope you don't get the list as long as my arm like I did. We too often assume because it says FDA approved that it is okay. Type in ""FDA approved devices and medicines that have caused serious injuries and death"" and I guarentee you you will be floored. Have you noticed all the Perscription drug advertisements that are now on television? Every day there are two or three more! Where are all these drugs coming from and who is doing all this testing?

His uncle took him in and has started to teach him to be a mechanic, but his dream to go to college and complete it and be able to drive,work, and live independent has been stopped. Since he is working for his uncle he has no health insurance. He is taking medicine which he can get from the manufacture, but I dont know if he is still on the right dose or what because his episodes are getting more often and more intense. I was hoping to find someone that could help him or tell me of anyone that would be willing to help with a low cost consultation, and or exam?

It varies from state to state so I am not sure what is available by you. He may also be eligible for SSI, which will provide him medical coverage.Now, on a lighter note, if he gets the epilepsy under control, I do not see any reason why he could not return to college and realize his dreams. He will not be permitted to drive again, but that is not the end of the world.

I have never been ""diagnosed"" as having epileptic or seizure activity; however, my family doctor highly suspected that I was, at the time when I last spoke to him about ""some"" of those symptoms a few years ago.  He told me it was up to me if I wanted to go on to see a specialist; but, feels since I am not suffering from convulsions, passing out, loss of memory, etc., that in ""my case"", it would probably be better if I do not go on to taking medications.  He felt the side affects from the medications could possibly produce some undesirable reactions/symptoms that may feel even more unpleasant than what I experience from my symptoms; but if, in the future, it progressed into convulsions, fainting, loss of time/ memory, etc. then it would be adviseable for me to look into getting help with medication.  It made since to me; therefore, I made the decision not to go to a specialist for a diagnosis at that time.  So, in all honesty to you lynseyiam and everyone else in this forum, I do not know if I suffer from any form of epileptic/seizure activity.  Up until now, I decided not to go to a specialist and spend the money to find out; because, I'm not going to take the medication at this time anyway.lynsyiam, have you contacted your doctor about how you are feeling and doing on this medication?  It may take a little time while your body adjusts to it.  But nonetheless, let him or her know.  It may help put you at ease to.Take care, and have a good day today &:  )","answer"

To sum it up, after her birth she had transient tachypnea, which is breathing difficulty She ended up getting bi-lateral pneumos (holes in her lungs) and needing 8 chest tubes. During her 'crash' her O2 was 10% and her blood PH was 6.85, the neurologist said she was a miracle as these numbers were incompatible with life. She is now two and has met or exceeded all milestones. She just recently started having these episodes at night and we are searching high and low for answers, unfortunately not getting any. She wakes up screaming, barely responsive to me being there, her right side of her body is limp and she falls to the right, she cant sit or stand for about 20minutes. after these 20 minutes she is able to answer my questions and hobble around a little, she is very shaky and will trip and fall pretty easily. Then she passes out for about a day, it is next to impossible to rouse her, which is SO far from normal for her. MRI and bloodwork is normal, no strokes even though is is losing control of her right side. The EEG also looks normal. Her second episode was about twice as severe and lasted longer, the residual effects of her last one lasted for about two days. Mostly just severe sleepiness. I am so afraid that they are going to keep getting worse and we will have no diagnosis. Any suggestions or ideas would mean the world to me! Thank you!!","question"

He wakes up sick and has no idea as to what happened to him. His MRI came out clear but the doctor said that his EEG showed seizure activity in his left frontal lobe and gave him an rx for Keppra.They didn't give him an explanation as to what the cause was and so I called them. The first nurse told me that he is having complex partial seizures. After looking at the information it's possible that some of the things he's always done in his sleep are really seizures. They didn't explain why he was convulsing during the day with no warning. He doesn't have any of the typical symptoms while he is awake. I called back and a different nurse told me that his diagnosis is generalized seizure disorder. I am very confused about how he could have both! Surely it's one or the other and not both, correct?They never asked about his sleep habits and if he is having seizures in his sleep, I'd like to know because my daughter acts the same way in her sleep. All we know is that they say he has some form of epilepsy and we'd feel better if we had a better understanding of it all.","question"

People with a generalized seizure disorder are usually born with it, while people with partial or complex partial get it sometime during thier life. Generlaized seizures occurr over the entire brain, while complex partial only occurr in a section of the brain.I have complex partial seizures that occurr in my right temporal lobe. They started from a head injury I got when I was three. They occurr only while I'm sleeping. These nocturnal seizures start off as complex partial but then turn into a genralized seizure later on. This is called a SECONDARY GENERALIZED SEIZURE. Since they start off as complex partial then they are treated as a complex partial seizure disorder. Almost every eplileptic with nocurtnal seizures have  'secondary genralized seizures'. Keppra well controls most epileptics with complex partial seizures. I transitioned from Tegretol to Keppra this past Spring and have not had a seizure since then.","answer"

These occurrences can occur intermittently over a period of days to weeks and months. This can be categorized into two types:1.  Benign Essential Blepharospasm, a non life threatening and is not caused by any identifiable factors; and 2)a neurological disorder like Tourette's syndrome. Any worsening or intensification of symptoms must be referred to an ophthalmologist. Hemi facial spasms which cause twitching in one side of the face and related to an irritation of the facial nerves must be ruled out.

It started almost 7 months ago when he was sitting in his highchair playing with toys all of a sudden his arms stiffened and shot stright up above his head which is not something he can do by himself. Also during that eposide his pupils dilated and his head would turn toward his right arm. These eposides would happen regularly  for a month or so then die off and return a few weeks later. His neurologist did a ph test that was normal and then an impedance study that had some abnormalites and they told us it was reflux and put him on 30mg of previcid twice a day. They also did an video eeg and said it was normal except that he had slower than normal brain activity. He went awhile with hardly any eposides and then all of a sudden one night started having then every night and we noticed new attrubits to them. We noticed that right before they would start his fingers will start turning in odd positions and then it will travel down his right arm until it would go up then it will just hang there for about 20 seconds and then his left arm will go out to his head will go to the right like before he will squint his eyes and grind his teeth. After that it will work its way down his body stiffening his back, torso, legs and feet until he is holding his whole body except his head off the floor with his heels. That will last about 40-50 seconds then his legs will free up and he will start laughing then shivering and finaly crying while he is laughing he will bycicle his legs and flail his arms. These eposide often last for three to four minutes. I don't what to do anymore afterwards he get very agitated and tired but can't seem to fall asleep and it seems like when he gets in a deep sleep they happen again he will have anywhere from one too four of the full eposide each night and in bettween they seem like they will wake him up with stiffening and then die off for a little while.

They put him on Keppra and he has not had a seizure since. I am still sleep deprived from anxieties I have developed from this whole thing with my son.

At the time I had been drinking alot of caffienated drinks and we put it down to that.yesterday night and the evening/morning of the day before I had the same thing, preceded by bad headaches and shivering and in the worst of the two cases followed by loss of words when talking (I wouldnt know what I wanted to say or what the name of something was, I just couldnt place it). I had been out and busy the last few days, hadnt eaten much that day and been drinking (a small amount) in the evening at a very close friends leaving party. I had noticed all afternoon/evening that my balance was really off, I was alot more clumsy than usual. Another friend had me stay at hers and the minute we got out of the car I started shivering badly (it wasnt cold) to the point where I couldnt walk very well. When I got in the house (which was warm) it got alot worse and eventually I ended up having sets of convulsions and blacking out.

I had her evaluated in Albany medical center where she was monitored on a video EEG. They have come to the conclusion this is NOT epilepsy. I was quickly referred to counseling for her. We have started counseling and even the Psychiatrist has already mentioned that she is puzzled becasue she is not presenting with any trauma, or issues. We will continue the therepy in case they can ""tease"" something out. My husband and I are concerned that something may have been missed since she is a well balanced happy kid. She has plenty of friends, is a ""B"" student and handles issues with a level head. We almost feel like, they can't figure it out so ""oh well, it must be psychological"" In case this matters...lights, cell phonjes, computers all bother her. She has frequent headaches and has difficulty sleeping.A typical seizure goes like this: She will be doing a variety of things, sometimes watching TV , playing a game, laughing with her friends or just about to fall asleep. She will feel like something is wrong because her heart hurts, she gets very hot and light headed. and her legs feel very heavy. She usually becomes unresponsive and stares for a moment or two. She will then fall to the ground sometimes injuring herself. She has violent shaking and bucking of her entire body. She does not become incontinent but  will always immediately have to urinate. She has bitten her lip a few times. The seizures occur 1-2 times daily but can be more often. they are short lasting less than 30 seconds each time and can have 2 or three in a row.We  have recently started accupuncture and herbal treatement in hopes this may help. It has helped minimally.Please advise us on what we should be doing, is a second opinion in order in a case like this?

Diagnosis may include a complete physical examination, including a detailed neuromuscular examination, an EEG (electroencephalograph) or a head CT scan or a cranial MRI may show the location and extent of the lesion. EEG shows characteristic changes confirming partial (focal) seizures, and may show the focus (location of the cause). What were the results of your tests? The early warning symptoms include: abnormal sensations, epigastric sensations,  hallucinations or illusions, sensation of deja vu, recalled emotions or memories, sudden, intense emotion not related to anything occurring at the time. During the seizure, consciousness may be maintained during the seizure or may be reduced or lost during the seizure. Discuss your symptoms and tests with your doctor for clarifications.

Accidents are common and for the most part preventable.  This arises as a result of driving or swimming. Usually common sense could prevent this from happening. Swimming with friends who knows about the illness and also knows what to do if it happens will help. And of course, don’t drive unless you are sure that you will not have another seizure behind the wheel.  Your neurologist can usually predict your chance of having another seizure by calculating from the times you have had a seizure and your longest seizure-free interval over the last few years.  Another accident which tends to occur is suffocation in a pillow in bed during seizure. .  If you have generalized tonic clonic seizures, then use a roll-type pillow, one which is firm and which cannot suffocate you.   If you can put your face in the pillow and you can still breathe, then the pillow is safe to use. One such thing is the golden pillow designed specially for babies.Golden Pillow Baby™ has been technologically developed to ensure comfortable and safe nights of sleeps for babies, helping to prevent them from suffocating while sleeping. This was made possible by the Double Respiration System, which allows babies to easily breath, even when facing the pillow during the sleep.

I hope you’re fine.  There are many people who feel the same way you do. People diagnosed with epilepsy face many difficulties and lifestyle changes, but a proper understanding of the disease is a very important step toward maintaining a normal life. With acceptance, you may let go of your fears and embrace your future with epilepsy. I think it would also be very helpful if you find a support group near your place or even in the internet.  This way you can meet people with the same situation you are in and do activities with them. One example of this is through this link: http://www.geocities.com/epilepsy911/ It is very important also that you take your   medications regularly to prevent seizure from happening and also to avoid seizure triggers like lack of sleep, alcohol or infections. You can learn more about this through this link:  http://www.epilepsy.org.uk/info/triggers.html	You’ll be fine. Life is beautiful. I hope this helps. Take care and regards.","answer"

Try not to worry, you probably need medications to control them.

Let me explain it this way.  When I was on Tegretol, I had many diagnoses for glasses and each year the prescription got worse and my eye sight seemed dull  and in fact the whole world seemed dull to my senses.  It was like looking at the world with someone elses eyes not my own.  While walking around the sidewalks, I sometimes came upon stop signs or red lights telling me not to cross the streets but, in my mind while on Tegretol, I went right ahead and crossed the street anyways. I had no sense of danger what-so-ever. My mind and eyes were clouded over to the extent that I really did not care wheather my actions got me killed or not.  Sometimes, the anti-seizures medications really do not allow us to think, see, or behave normally.We either elect to keep taking these drugs for our seizures or we elect to stop taking them and go back to having seizures.  With some people having the siezures and dealing with their side effects is better than taking all those Anti-Siezure medication and their side effects.Alll people take siezure medication should have someone watching out for and over them while taking these medications.  Well, that is my opinion or two cents worth.","answer"

A month ago, I was feeling a lot of heartburn and so I took my mother's prilosec along with my Yasmin and went straight to bed. Because of indigestion, I did not have dinner that night either. At around 2am, I woke up to use the restroom and I clearly remember voiding but what happened afterwards, I have no recollection of that. Apparently, I fainted and fell down on the floor. My mother heard a big thump she walked. From what she described, I was having a seizure. When I came back to my senses, i noticed I had bit my tongue and inside of my cheek. I was taken to ER and they ran some blood tests, and CT scan that was normalIt was my very first seizure at age 25. I have no family history of seizure disorders. I have been a vegetarian all my life.I do have is Vitamin B12 deficiency, severe sleep disturbance, life full of stress and lack of rest. Before this seizure, I had been noticing that I was having sx. of orthostatic hypotension. Later on, in my EEG some spikes were noticed during hyperventilation, which the neurologist thinks is consistant with generalized seizure disorder. I do not agree with my neurologist. I seriously think what happened was because of prilosec and long term history of B12 deficiency. Do you think my deficiency has something to do with my spiked EEG?","question"

In some Eastern Cultures they believe in listening to your body for, it knows more what you need than you do yourself.  I would ask your doctor for a CBC, this stand for Complete Blood Count.  This test would give you more clues as to what area to look at first.  It is like the diagnostic test of an automobile acept it is for the human body.I would personally check your levels of Magnesium, Calcium, and B-Complex Levels in your blood.  I take Magnesium, Calcium, Vitamin D, Folic Acid, and Vitamin B6 on a daily basis.  I eat only foods that are healthy for me. Also keep in mind that the older you get past 30 try eating more vegetables and grains in your diet and less meat, unless it is fish, chick or fish.Taking the Prilossec might have been a one time occurance and it may never happen agaiin.  What you can do for yourself is keep a small diary and wrtie down every time you experience Anxiety and/or seizure like symptoms.  Then, collect all those notes and show your Neurologist these notes.  Taking Anti-Seizure medications when you do not have a seizure disorders is very bad for the body.  Work with your doctor and neurologist and get to the root cause.

If I do not sleep during the night because of seizure activites, I sleep during the day time.  I found out what foods that do not agree with me and avoid them and that helps too. I have bought an LCD monitor instead of a CRT monitor.  That helps me, too. I do the flooding method outside my house in the drive way and my street in front of my home.  Each day I walk as fast of a pace up and down in front of my house, each time trying to walk further.  But, there is always that invisible wall that says this is a far as you can go mister.The problem is the federal governments sends out their little spies.

Tell me that you could survive on that much money and two children to feed and cloth whom depend upon you.

Remember, I had three head injuries while in the space of 10 yrs. Two on top right part of head and one on right temple area. Since that time, I have had problems with my hand writing and typing. Sometimes I misspell words, leave out letters, and sometimes I leave out whole words.  I have to constantly go back over my words and use the back space key constantly. Can we say brain injury again.I am now and have always been totally disabled since leaving the military service in 1982.  I have not worked any where since that time. Agoraphobia, Anxiety, and Grand Mal Siezures in 1975.  Back during the 1970's and early 1980's you could still serve in the US Army even if you had seizure disorder.My Agoraphobia has been going on too long to be able to just pick up and leave the house or front yard when ever I feel like it.  I need a therapist and medications to be able to go back into riding in vehicles again. At present time, I cannot ride in any vehicle down the road going any distance. I get nausea, disorientation, which leads to confusion and panic attacks.  Cars make left and right turns and they go up and down hills.  I become disoriented immediately when that happens.  I can spin around in my swible chair and on second round, I do not know my own name and if I stood up, I would fall flat on my face. I cannot watch television if the camera is moving in an odd pattern or diagnally.  I cannot ride even in an amusement ride of any kind because of the disorientation and confusion.  Disorientation leads to confusion and that leads to panic attack. If the panic attack last too long it sends me into a grand mal seizure.I am currently doing the flooding method to help relieve the Anxiety and get some exercise to boot. The flooding method is where you walk as far from the house as you can get before you start to panic and, you do the same in the other direction.  I always walk in a straight line back and forward only. I cannot stand up straight and look up or down while keeping my head straight. My eyes give me imediate dull pains. If I look straight ahead everything is ok.The state ID card requires me to ride in my sons car for a very long distance and, I have to wait 4 hours after getting there.  The VA Administration said they would send me out a doctor to my home every month once, the VA declares me a disabled veteran.  They went on to say they would provide a therapist as well if needed.  I have been waiting 26 yrs now for their decision on my claim.Currenly, I have medare for my insurance but, without State ID Card it is useless to me. I currently have two large card board boxes stacked full of medical records stating where, how, and when I was hurt both military and civilian recorded documents.  So far the VA Administration will not accept any of my medical records tests results. They will not accept the US Army doctor medical reports as well.  I currently take herbal medicines and vitamin suppliments to help controll my Anxiety and Epilepsy.  I still have a grand mal seizure once a week though.","answer"

Doctors refused to believe my statements and wife statements.1975 -1982, no treatments  for seizures or anxiety which developed later.  1982 - 2008 no treatments for Agoraphobia, Anxiety, or Seizures at any VA Hospitals.  VA Administration refuse to admit I even had Epilepsy or Anxiety or Agroraphobia.  To admit I had these disorders would have to pay me from the time of the active duty service.  They would have to pay me $850,000. in back pay right now.Since, 1975 to present time.  Months where I would be house-bound and constantly having to worry how my two children and how they were going to eat or clothes on their backs. I could not find employment anywhere aft discharged. I was looking older than my staed age. Sometimes, I would have remissions and without warning the seizures would start up again.  Panic Attacks, Agoraphogia, and seizures would keep me home again.  All I had to try to live on was Welfare and food stamps fro the first 7 years after I was discharged. In 1989, I was examined by the Western Neurology Group of Denver, CO.  They told me, I had Complex Partial Seizures for a long time in their medical opinion and they started me on Tegretol a few years later, they took me off the Tegretol and refused to give me anymore medication.  I stilll have and always have had at least one seizure per week since 1882 to present time.  Some years were worse that others throughout my life so far.I have medical documentation from military about head injury 1975, 1977, and 1981.  Still no civilian doctors, military, or VA Hospita. doctor will accept their very own findings. I have two cardboard boxes of medical documentation of my head injuries and treatments for head injury types of treatment.  Each time, the doctors would give me treatement for Anxiety and seizures but, would not put the words Epilepsy or Generalizied Anxiety or Agoraphobia down on paper.  Go figure.  The US Government. will not given me any further help until I get a government doctor to write down on paper officially that I have Epilepsy, Anxiety, and Agoraphobia.  In 2007, the VA Hospital and Civilian Hospitals around my home in Colorado told me there would be no more medications sent my way until I can get a government appoved Neurology Group to put down in writing I have  Epilepsy, Anxiety, and Agoraphobia.All three of my Ex-wives have all left me and I have had to take care of my children in the past time.  I have one child left.  He has Autism and must be looked after for life. I cannot leave the home for the last 8 years now.  I have Grand Mal Seizures now days every week now.  My oldest son has to leave the home and do all  of my shopping for food and clothing.  I am now totally house-bound.  Tell me that all this wasy not somekind of government punishment. My ID card expired 3 yrs ago and, it takes waiting in line for 4 hours to get a new one.  My Agoraphobia and Anxiety want let me sit down that long to wait.  In Colorado they want give you no kind of medications without a current state ID Card.  The VA Hospital will not send out a home doctor without being recognized by the US Army as an official Veteran of the US Government.  I received 3 honorable discharges in my lifetime.  As my Disabled American Veteran Lawyer states, they (US Government) wants you and others like to to lay down and die because, they owe you guys too many back pays in dollar amounts.This is how it effects me on daily basis.  Three head injuries and worries on daily basis on how to pay for food, clothing, and shelter now and in the future.","answer"

She has also been seizure free for 5 years, and feels great.She gets occasional migraines, and has fatigue (probably from lack of exercise) but all in all is a healthy woman.  She is very adament about not taking her meds because she has seizures very seldom- and she noticed that she actually had MORE seizures while taking the medication- averaging 3 every year- VS being seizure free for years at a time without ANY meds.My advice? Listen to your body. It is always talking to us. I am a firm believer that just because you have epilepsy, it does NOT by any means, mean that you need to take pills every day-- especially if you can control it WITHOUT meds. Its all about how its controlled, and how often the person has seizures. I would venture a guess that being on meds for 30 years for this person, by now, would have caused some sort of other maladies in the body- liver decline, bone density problems, Vitamin D deficiency (many epilepsy meds cause this) so it's all about the trade off.Is the quality of life good without meds?

I unfortunately know all too much about status seizures and except for my parrot Max I live alone.  A risky choice but mine.  Good neighbors help, make sure I take the meds, stop by a few times a day and what they can, but I wasn't afraid anymore and now I am again and it just really *****. Thanks for taking the time to offer your insights.  I think I'll just stay in bed for a year or two.","answer"

Or do you have a live in partner that can administer fast acting meds when you have these seizures? I hesitate to recommend daily meds, because when you get on them for a time, then abruptly stop, that can cause status seizures as well. I'm sure you know that though.

Celexa worked a little for my anxiety but I still had a siezure. The large siezures i've had are usually brought on by me having anxiety its how it starts , their like blackouts , my husband said my eyes roll back , my jaw and body lock up and I stop breathing for a short time. Its kind of wierd , and I noticed that when the big ones happen its only when I've gone out drinking and gotten stressed out. I dont drink but on occasion , so those siezures dont happen often. I originally sought out a neurologist after my first big expeirence with these siezures which ended up happening multiple times throughout that night , and for the first time experienced not recognizing anyone around me. When every these episodes happen I can hear everyone around me but i can not respond , is that normal in siezures? thank you so much for responding to me , its been a little frustrating not knowing whats going on, and getting medical care has been stressful my husbands military so I have to go through like 6 doctors to get a neurology referral again.

(3/200 mgs 6X daily)She didn't take her medication for two days because she ""didn't want to"".  So, she ended up having 4 seizures in a 4 hour period. My mom didn't call 9-1-1 because my sister is already $30,000.00 in medical debt and is filing for bankruptcy. She has had 4 prior trips to ER for the exact same reason- skipping doses and having multiple seizures.My mom called the doctor who told her to go pick up Diastat in suppository form from the pharmacy.She recieved 2 doses of 20mg Diastat gel, to be inserted in the anus.  For TWO DOSES it cost my mom $312.00.Diastat is Diazepam, which is Valium. So I was wondering...My friend has scoliosis, and she gets RX Valium. She offered to give me half of her prescription in order to keep it as an emergency stash for my sister should she have another bout of seizures.My question is this: How many MG's should be administered at a time, and should the dosage be crushed and forced into the persons mouth after a seizure- or can you make a home made suppository with it?Please help.","question"

The bond we have is stronger than any pet, any parent, any loved one I have ever had-- I almost wish we WEREN'T twins for that reason.Every time she has her status epilepticus, EVERY time, I know and I call- something nagging me from inside says ""Call your sister"".  One time, I was with my mother, and I said ""Have you talked to P today?"" My mom said ""Yes, earlier...""  And for some reason I had to just go over there. So I drove over there, and what do you know?  Her boyfriend was watching a movie, and she has in the past 30 minutes had 6 seizures, and was breathing quite shallow on the couch. I asked her bf why he didnt call. Me. Or 911. Or anyone. He said, ""Well she told me not to call 911 if she had a seizure because she cant afford it.""  So after becoming SO filled with rage at his negligence towards an obvious urgent situation that required immediate medical attention, we practically carried her to the car and drove to the ER, where she has two more seizures in the ER-- AFTER WAITING FOR NEARLY TWO HOURS TO GET A DOCTOR TO SEE HER.  She was in ICU for 5 days.

I see a moral dilemma in a certain RX costing $200 to fill, but knowing I can go to a friend and buy the same dosage for 75% less than the RX. Yes, its illegal. Common sense prevails on this one over any law. If you have been through this, the whole insurance propoganda, coupled with having NO money, and almost NO willingness to take the drug in the first place, I believe you would do the same thing. If she-- right now-- started having a bunch of siezures, and if I had some unprescribed valium on me- I wouldn't even hesitate to give them to her for fear that it is illegal. The law or her life is the way I look at it- and I'll err on the side of saving her life- or her brain.The ER has never turned her down- but the fact is, every time she goes, she accrues anywhere from $1000.00 all the way up to $15,000.00 in debt. She is already about 30k in debt, which was sent to collections after 3 months- and they are threatening to garnish her wages should she work, or apply for unemployment. This 30k is all ER debt. So, although they will always accept her as a patient, she is forced to come to terms with the debt and file BK or simply ignore it, as she is not in a place mentally where she can work (they will garnish her if she does work anyhow).The samples thing is a good point; however, moot. When she has an episode at 4am, we cannot do anything but frantically call her DR and have him write a script. These episodes are so unpredictable that getting samples isn't in the cards. And, the DR did write her a script for suppositories at her latest appt- but samples are RARELY given for benzodiazepines as they are highly addictive.Anti-depressants? She wont take them. Already has, and thats a losing battle. She hates them. She will not address her depression. Or her weight. Or the fact that she has epilepsy.  Lame.Compassion only goes so far.. Then you get to a point where you say, ok.. I've tried to understand, I've tried to help. I've tried to just BE there. For 5 years, the same stuff has happened. Like clockwork- she takes her meds, gets depressed, doesnt take them, has a string of seizures, blames my father, starts her meds again. For a few months its fine, then the pattern begins ALL over again. Is it worth it though when she continues to self destruct, in the process, hurting her entire family and placing blame on everyone but herself? No. It's like dealing with a drug addict- you can be there and support them, you can enable them, or you can peacefully exit the situation until they hit rock bottom. I choose the latter.","answer"

If your sister doesn't take anti seizure meds because ""didn't  want too"" then dying from what sounds like status epelepticus, (I think that's spelled correctly) is what she's looking foward too, and not trying to insult, but the 300 lbs. sounds like a death wish to me. That much weight and the incredible stresses on everything, but the heart is my main concern, that status seizures cause (does she know this?) means that every episode of this type siezure might very well be the last, and that is no exageration whatever. Multiple problems that I hope you can find some way to cope, but until your sister 'grows up' and realizes the depth of her problems there's not any more you can do than what sounds like a lot. There's injectible valium which is a whole lot cheaper than $312 for two doses! Yikes, that's criminal, probably costs 50 cents to produce, and again, not trying to insult, but with all that weight worrying about hitting the sciatic(sp?) nerve or something probably isn't an issue. A regular needle probably wouldn't reach it, plus it's not hard at all to learn intramuscular injections. While I.V. is what's called for with status siezure's, your sisters attitude and the unsustainable (it sounds like) costs, what else can you do?  A homemade suppository? Maybe, don't really know but it's probably possible and ask a doctor for advice on dosage. A tiny person can take lots and lots of valium and have no problems, except maybe sleeping a day or two. Not enough details given, but the advice, amended well not to use any health food stuff to replace meds. is well stated and am glad 2sharp is sharp enough to realize the ommision. My problems are complicated and involve lots of medications and since I'd never been sick before and I was trying to fight a fight I didn't how too I had a couple of ""I'm not going to take any more of these damn pills"" episodes and almost died both times. That decision's on your sisters head and besides advice and encouragement, that's all you can do. Take a break from trying to deal with her self inflicted problem, you sound like you need and deserve a break from trying to help someone that won't help themselves. If ever again she decides she ""doesn't want to"" take medications it sounds like someone else has the compassion (and money) to provide, maybe (don't know where you are), but in many places family can have an involuntary commitment made to some psyc. hospital and let her stew over her stupidity in one of those. That's what my family did and it was a great favor and kindness. Is your sister selfish enough to do something so, sorry, but just plain old dumb with no thought to the problems and anxiety she spreads to you?  I'm getting less sympathetic towards your sister and more to you so having given what I know about the subject I'll shut up before I write what I'd like to tell her.

Sometimes these seizures are caused by an abnormality in the temporal lobe, such as a tiny scar or tumor, but often no identifiable cause is found.Temporal lobe seizures frequently are preceded by an aura, which is caused by an electrical discharge. Auras can consist of a  sudden sense of unprovoked fear,  a  deja vu experience. The aura is actually a small seizure itself.These seizures are characterized by one- to two-minute episodes of loss of awareness or contact with your surroundings. During the seizure, you may smack your lips, swallow repeatedly or pick at things with your fingers(automatisms). You may be confused for a few minutes and may have difficulty speaking. You may not be able to recall  the events that occurred during their temporal lobe seizure.This may appear to be deliberate to others who may not know that you are experiencing this.ref:http://www.cnn.com/HEALTH/library/DS/00266.html","answer"

But before this there were times but not as bad. My daughter is almost 9 and almost 2 years ago she was at her grandmothers and she had just went to sleep. Shortly after her grandmother heard what sounded like my daughter choking. She would stare and was unresponsive. She got her to come to by putting ice on her and turning on cartoons. My daughter is ADHD and the time they had just put her on Aterol. Her doctor figured that this was a side effect and took her off the medicine. We had tried several medicines before we actually found one that worked. She started taking ritalin in the generic form. Well about 2 months ago she did the same thing again shortly after going to bed except this time it was harder to bring her out of it. She was at her grandmothers again. The doctor wanted to take her off sweets to see if it was possibly diabetes. But he also scheduled her for an appointment to see a neurologist to see if she was possible epileptic, but that wasn't until the end of August. Well last night shortly after she went to bed my fiance went in to check on her and her sister and found her shaking. When I got into her room her eyes were rolled back and she had her teeth clinched with a gray type of vomit coming out to the side of her mouth. She was in the fetal position and shaking. I could not get her to come too. I know now that I'm to get her on her side and not to mess with her. But I was so scared at the time. We got her to the ER. They have ran tests on her and everything came out fine. Then she had a C-T Scan and that was fine also. I'm wondering, because I've noticed and her grandmother has noticed that this usually happens when she skips supper. We try not to skip it, but sometimes church has run late or like yesterday we had been out of town and ate a large, but late lunch. So no one was hungry when we got home.

She sleeps in the same room as her grandmother when she's their. I've quit my job to be with her more and to be able to make it to any appointments if a possible cancellation comes up at the neurologist that we are scheduled to see around the end of September.  That was the closest date and doctor that we could find that would accept medicaid.  We did find one before this about 4 hours away, that was the august appointment, but they called us and canceled it for whatever reason that they had.  My question to the doctor if he sees this and also to you kim, what do i do about her getting sleep and me getting some too? I'm a nervous wreck when she's asleep.  Thank you both for commenting back to me.","answer"

It’s good to hear that the tests and ct scan were fine. It is good to see the neurologist to check if your daughter really has epilepsy. ADHD and epilepsy are both relatively common conditions and may often occur together.For the meantime, try not to let her skip dinner because this may trigger the attack. What is also important is how to prevent your daughter from self-injury during the seizure by moving her away from sharp edges, placing something soft beneath her head and carefully placing her on her side to prevent aspiration.  If the seizure lasts longer than 5 minutes, this requires immediate hospitalization and emergency treatment. I hope this helps. Take care and keep me posted.","answer"

Anticonvulsant medications may need frequent adjustments,monitoring of anticonvulsant medications with laboratory tests may be necessary.

Stress in the body or illness usually triggers seizure. According to research, stress can cause changes in the brain which affect how the nerve cells work with each other, especially those around any damaged areas of the brain. This can increase the risk of seizures occurring.There are other possible seizure triggers such as skipping of medication, hormones, drugs or food. You can learn more about this through this link: http://www.epilepsy.org.uk/info/triggers.html	Sometimes, you do not remember what happens during or even after the seizure. It is advisable to have medical alert tags so that the people around you will know what to do. It is helpful also to have support groups in your area or even in the net, one example is:  http://www.geocities.com/epilepsy911/ I hope this helps. Take care and keep me posted.","answer"

For patients with PSE, it is especially hazardous to view television in a dark room, at close range, or when the television is out of adjustment and is showing a rapidly flickering image.No cure is available for PSE, although the sensitivity of some patients may diminish over time. Medical treatment is available to reduce sensitivity, with sodium valproate being commonly prescribed. Patients can also learn to avoid situations in which they might be exposed to stimuli that trigger seizures and/or take steps to diminish their sensitivity (as by covering one eye) if they are unavoidably exposed. These actions together can reduce the risk of seizures to almost zero for many PSE patients.ref:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosensitive_epilepsy","answer"

I stumbled Smelled some thing like Rotten dead cat mixed with Burning rubber. I got up said mom she turned around. she asked me if i was ok after the trip i had. i said yah, with a slur and then mindlessly followed her to her side of the car and when she asked me what i was doing i said Ohh turned around went back be hind the car to get to the other side and, Apparently Went as stiff as a BOaRD  and fell over my hands stayed in their positions NO jerking just stiff then she said my eyes were rolled up and i was drooling then. I have only had that one BUT the EEG i had 1 month after then the other one 3 months after and the one 9 months after still show irregular Brain waves. in my left frontal lobe. I was 19 when i had my first seizure. Leeding up to that I  was having REALLY bad facial, and body tics along with some vocal ones too.. my neurologist had put me on an anti tic medication but i was wanting to join the airforce at the time so she was weening me off the anti tic meds, they were a muscle relaxant of some kind i have the name saved if any one wants to know it. In order to join the air force i had to med free for a year. Bahh I am very glad now that i am not in the airforce. I am very happy with my Current major, I am on 3,000 mg of Keppra now 1500 2 times daily.I dont know some times the meds make me Anoyed with every thing Its just not like me. thats bothersome when it is happening but i ussually if i have the opertunity to, is go some where by my self and studdy. If i am with others when i am IN THE MOOD pit They anoy me soo much and end up not being so pleasent. If i am at work and it happens I bite my toung... litteraly LOL. My nerologist thinks that my Tics were a seizure. THEY are not nearly even 1% as bad as they were even on the other anti tic medication. What i have learned though is That i get mildly ticky is i am really streased out or am feeling a Aura. I feel like i will be zipping forward then hault in my place and fly back in to my body... thats what i mean by aura, the other type i have had recently is when walking and stressed Like durring finals week and i have not gotten enough sleep. it feels like my right leg slips through the ground like in a invisable hole. and then pops back out when i take my next step. it does not physically Change the way i am walking when it happens it just is the weirdest sensation ever........AS for tests If u could get a EKG AND EEG combo. it sorts out cardio and the brain stuff all at once.","answer"

However, i have not suffered any seizures, black outs or loss of consciousness (sorry about the spellings folks) 16 years to the day i had a car accident and was badly battered in the accident. 3-4 years ago i started to notice foul smells on occasions (thought i was going mad, visited the GP who said everything was fine) I also suffer bouts of not being able to find a word in my head during a conversation. I have likened this to a person who has had a stroke and cant remember the words. (mine is only occasionally and not always the same words.)The consultant whom i saw yesterday said that the smells were auras and that loss of the wording was perhaps a build up to a full blown seizure.The initial response was to remove me from the car, give me tablets and wait and see. I argued my case and am having a repeat MRI but had a EEG 6 weeks ago and this is the results from that.Has anyone else experienced the same symptopms as me? is this epilepsy like there saying?

Not all epileptic seizures are grand mal.  I've had epilepsy for 22 years, and I control mine without medication. Sometimes, people have MORE seizures on medication, which was the case for me.Here are some great tips:AVOID CAFFEINE AND ARTIFICIAL STIMULANTS - the central nervous system doesn't need the aggravationMAKE SURE YOU ALWAYS GET PLENTY OF REST - the body needs adequate sleeptime, and epileptics ESPECIALLY need itAVOID FLASHING LIGHTS LISTEN TO YOUR BODY - I always have an aura before a seizure.  I begin to feel weak, nausea sets in and I just begin to go limp.  During my seizures, I cannot respond to any voices, but I HEAR EVERYTHING.  MAKE OTHERS AWARE OF WHAT NOT TO DO - people tend to overreact and panic. This only makes things worse. Tell them what to expect...if you know yourself, and ask them to simply make sure that your vital signs are OK.  People freak out when a person's eyes roll or when their body jerks.  This was all completelly normal for me, and it just had to run it's course.  Still does when I overdo things or get too stressed out.EAT RIGHT & TAKE GOOD SUPPLEMENTS - People with epilepsy should keep certain supplements on hand.  Calcium, B-Complex, EPA/DHA (fish oil), SOY LECITHIN and VALERIAN.  These are all great for neurotransmitters and for handling stress.  The Valerian is good to help you relax during a seizure.  Grab it and take it AS SOON AS you begin to have an aura.TALK OPENLY WITH YOUR DOCTOR, CHIROPRACTOR, ACUPUNCURIST or other HOLISTIC PRACTITIONER.Medicine for seizures is VERY HARD on the liver.  Don't accept a life sentence on those drugs if at all possible.  Look for natural solutions.  They are out there.  I highly recommend Shaklee supplements to people because they have changed my life.  They are pharmaceutical grade & the science behind them is superior.  There website's ABOUT SHAKLEE tab is very informational.......worth a look!GOD BLESS YOU.  I hope this helps, and I hope it just all goes away.  If not, just become as informed as you can on the subject.  Ask questions, and always question answers!!!","answer"

The key for ME has been to make sure I get enough rest and avoid too much stress.  Stress is a big factor with seizures for me.......and when you think about the things that you CAN CONTROL in your daughter's life...things like keeping her away from white sugar, caffeine and anything that stimulates the central nervous system.Calcium (natural, not store brands) is also nature's tranquilizer....so making sure she gets plenty of good calcium supplements is also a must.  I have found this to be true in one of my twins who also seems to have neurology problems.  If he goes w/o calcium for too long, he has lots of undesirable side effects.I tell people to use Shaklee products which can be found online.  The science behind them is phenomenal. It's the reason I chose them.I hope this info is helpful.  Oh..........make sure to give your daughter B-Complex after an episode.  It may not take the headache completely away, but it is a Stress Vitamin (along with Vitamin C) and it will definitely help!Hope this was helpful.","answer"

Whenever the victim is anxious the adrenaline and cortisone are released in the blood stream. It quickens the heart with palpitation, breathing becomes shallow; the muscles becomes tense; the energy is wasted with this abnormal situation which leads to unbounded tiredness and headache.Ross has defined it, as a series bf symptoms, which arise from faulty adaptation to the stresses and strain of life. It is caused by over action in an attempt to meet these difficulties.Anxiety neurosis is a psychosomatic disorder.  Generally having distressing sensation of confinement or being fenced in the feeling of being helplessly exposed to some indeterminate threat, mental unrest and tension, is feature of anxiety.It requires proper counseling and medications.since it is to do with one, personality it can remain with you for life unless you take appropriate measures to deal with it.ref:http://www.homeomiracles.com/Index/Psychiatry/Psychiatry_article/Anxiety_Neurosis/Anxiety%20Neurosis.htmlref:http://www.depression-guide.com/anxiety-neuroses.htmA complex partial seizure is an epileptic seizure that is limited to one cerebral hemisphere and causes impairment of awareness or responsiveness.Once consciousness is impaired, the person may display automatisms such as lip smacking, chewing, or swallowing.They may be more likely in people who have had a head injury, brain infection, stroke, or brain tumor but most of the time the cause is unknown.Ithink that if you are dealing with your anxiety in the right way you can definitely get some control over your mind.When you are no longer exhibiting the symptoms of anxiety neurosis and then if you get these seizure like symptoms then it would be  acceptable that you do have a physical problem.ref:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_partial_seizure","answer"

This is after evidence from prior EEG's that I was having them.   I did have a reaction to the grids, which numbed up my arms and metal feeling in my mouth, unable to speak, and couldn't think straight.  I had a severe pain in the recent surgery area at this time.  I was told later that this showed seizure activity.    When I came out of the temporal lobe surgery I was told that the scarred area was removed and that there was hypocampus damage that was removed also.  I guess my question would be how could a statement about ""paroxysmal event"" be written with what was said after the surgery.  Or, the other statement saying  ""pre-existing nonepileptic events are likely to come back after surgery.  I am just so confused with these things mentioned in a medical report, which I was surprised was sent to me.  Defined on an EEG report and an MRI scan showing scarring, how could these statements be said?  Please help me understand.   Thank you!","question"

(http://www.epilepsy.org.au/pdfs/EA_360_Dec_2007_p4_5.pdf)However, the sensitivity of bed alarms according to a study Danish Epilepsy Center  is only 15-20 %. (http://www.epilepsihospitalet.dk/Portals/1/Forskning/Renes%20poster%20helsinki.pdf) The decision will still be up to you. There are a lot of products advertised in the net or you can get in touch with your local support group to know more about the pros and cons of having these seizure monitoring systems and alarms.I hope this helps.

She has been diagnosed with refractory complex partial and generalized seizures. She has also been diagnosed with seizures during sleep. I noticed recently when she is sleeping she would have these movements that looks like twitching and shrugging her shoulder/s. Sometimes her shoulders and arms will jump up inches off her body. Sometimes it would happen 1 or 2 times in a row sometimes up to 10-15 times rhythmically. Sometimes it's both arms at the same time and sometimes it's 1. Sometimes it's the fingers, head or the face (eyes, mouth, cheeks) and sometimes it starts with the fingers then goes to the arm then head/face and other arm. I have even seen her stomach twitch. Sometimes they arouse her to make her turn over. Then it's like they start all over again. My daughter also has them anywhere from 1 sec. to a few seconds to 1 minute to a couple of minutes apart. All the way to a few hours apart. I notice it more in the morning before she wakes up after the nights sleep although she also does it if she takes a nap. I have been video taping her while she sleeps and her pedi neuro said she had Myoclonic jerks, but didn't feel like they were seizures. She said the jerks I showed her are every second and that wasn't fast enough to be a seizure. How fast should they be to be considered a seizure? I showed her on a 3"" screen. So I don't think she saw it that good. I am confused as to why this is happening she wakes up with real bad headaches. She has also had since birth at different times where her tongue quivers for a while then it stops. The pedi neuro didn’t know what to think of it. Now I have seen and also taped where her arm does this weird movement. I wasn’t sure how to describe it, but my little boy said her arm moves like jello. So it shakes in small increments sideways not like a muscle twitch that jumps vertically. I showed the pedi neuro and she wasn’t sure why or what was happening, but isn’t concerned. Should I be?  She is on 5 different seizure med.  Carbatrol XR 1600mg a day, Lamictal 800mg a day just dropped to 400mg a day, Phenobarb 194.4 mg at bed, Topamax 400mg a day, and just added Depakote XR 500mg a day. We had just completed another Neropsych eval. And it shows that she has declined mentally we are not sure if it is because of medicine or the seizures. We are changing her meds around and will be taking her off some and do another Neuropsych eval in the fall. Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.","question"

So I took her to her dr. today and was told she will be referred to a pediatric neurologist but that the wait period will be 5 months! Her development  so far is on target and the only other concern is that her right eye moves a little to the right when she looks at an object in front of her.

Can  the cause of the seizures hurt her even more with no treatment or no real diagnosis and if it is not diagnosed as early as possible? I have her next appointment in two months. Please help me make informed decisions about her care and if we can wait 5 months to see a specialist. Also, her mother used cocaine during the first 5 months of her pregnancy.

This was just after the birth of my son, now 4, and at that consult the only focus was the unconscious seizures with the description I have already disclosed here.  He did not ask questions,nor did he try to have me look into whether I  also had any other symptoms. It was only this spring I began to focus on the details of what I experience by journaling EVERYTHING I see, eat, drink, do, feel etc... that I cocluded these patterns.  I have lived with this for so long I feel like most of the symptoms I experience, my body just did not notice so to speak.  Sort of like living beside a waterfall, after awhile, you just do not hear it unless you listen. (Just with the absences)  This Neurologist laid a diagnosis of syncope after the EEG was normal.  Just recently, I have learned that even epileptics can have normal EEG's if it is taken when there is no episode occuring at the time.  Also, my daughter has had a normal EEG after her initial one that provided her with a diagnosis of Petit Mal, with symptoms of Partial Complex Temporal Lobe epilepsy, adding she has unusual length to her episodes suggesting a nature of status elepticus. I have seen this same Neurologist again, recently, and he has ordered an MRI, and another EEG.  My concern is that if these come up normal, despite my symptoms being almost identical to my diagnosed daughter's symptoms, I will remain syncopal.  It is frustrating, as my family physician constantly states I do not have seizures, when I clearly do.  I hate that he makes light of them, and tells me "" I internalize too much, and he can't help me"".  He treats me like I am a mental case and I am very unhappy with his mannerism. Are there tests that can prove syncope?  aside from a normal EEG?( When speaking with the children's Pediatrician, he agrees a normal EEG proves nothing other than no activity at the time of testing, and does not ""prove anything for differential diagnosis.   Also, I am very concerned as my oldest son, and youngest son, bear many similarities.... and instinctively, I feel this is not syncope.  I am more concerned that if this is a genetic issue....(knowing it is rare)  what can I do to rule this out? I look at my daughter and her symptoms fit very nicely into ADPEAF or IDPEAF. My family is in a dire need of testing and proper evidence to attain a diagnosis for each of us, that a relatively normal life can be provided to each of us. I just cannot grasp that if we all bear such similarities to the only one in our family that has a diagnosis, why we are  being treated like it is a mental health issue.  If it was an internalizing issue, then would not a seizure happen at the highest levels of stress all the time?  And how is it that for me...this has been going on since I was 10?  Do you have anything to shed any light on this? I will most certainly let you know what the result of the EEG and MRI are.  Most likely these will be complete within 2 months.   Thank you again.  It feels nice to hear someone say this situation leans more toward epilepsy.

That is when I started going to Dr.'s MRI's and GOD knows what other test.  I went back to Cleveland several times, first I was told it wasn't the tumor, then oh maybe it was.  I then went to Mayo Clinic, I seen the head neurosurgeon, he tells me that my seizures are NOT from my tumor!   They did many test thinking that the water from the flood may have caused something.  All negative.   I have an average of  3 seizures per week. I was in a rear -end collision on May 5, 2008.  I was told that I had two fractured vertabrae in my neck one possible old (possible old makes no sense to me)  I was put in intensive care overnight, I spent 2 more night in the hospital.  I was in great pain, I had 4 seizures the day of the accident one at the seen.  (I laugh when i have my seizures they last 45 sec to 4 min) OK now my question is this, I have been wearing my soft neck collar since May 7th.  I have not had ONE seizure after the day of the accident!!  I have always believed that there was something wrong with my neck that was causing my seizures.  This makes me believe it.  Every time I take off the collar, it takes about 30 minutes and I start felling the numbness start in the left side of my face top of my head my nose and my gums. Then down my left arm.  After I put the collar back on it takes about 30 minutes and it start going away!!              The tingling and numbness is part of other neoro symptoms that I get when I have aggravated my neck (that started 4 years ago), which I haven't done for over a year.  My question is what can the collar be stopping, nerve pinched?? I have no idea I only know that for the last 4 years I have been telling Dr's all over the country that the cause was my NECK!!  I feel that this proves it!!   What do you think.","question"

According to some web-sites I looked at, it is possible to have just one seizure in your life, it doesn't necessarily mean that you have epilepsy or you will have another seizure.You need to see a neurologist and have an EEG done.  EEG is painless, they stick electrodes to your scalp and a few on your body, they have you lay down, the tech will ask you to breath quickly almost hyperventilating quick. They will then have you lay there and they like to get a person to take a nap to see the resting waves I am assuming.  It takes about an hour.I am new to this seizure thing, being diagnosed with it just yesterday. I don't have grand mal seizures, I have uncontrollable muscle spasms and tremors, they cause me to fall down a lot and drop things. I get scared too, it is quite alright to feel that way.  If you ever need to talk, I am only a message away.Do you take medications? Were you doing something strenuous?  Pain in itself can cause a person to pass out, I simply tell my family that my body has had enough and my brain checked out for awhile when I do that from the pain.

Many people who have these seizures experience odd feelings — ranging from euphoria to fear — at the onset of their seizures.Because it's typically localized to one part of the brain, temporal lobe seizure is classified as a type of complex partial seizure.The temporal lobes lie along the sides of your head, just above your ears. Seizures that begin in those lobes often stem from an anatomical defect or scar. But many temporal lobe seizures have an undetermined cause.These types of seizures affect all age groups. People who have temporal lobe seizures usually remain conscious during a seizure, but they lose awareness of their surroundings and rarely remember what happened. Signs can include lip-smacking or picking at clothes.Temporal lobe seizures are particularly resistant to anti-seizure medications. Surgery may be a good option for many people, especially if their seizures consistently begin in the same location within the temporal lobe. Many people become seizure-free when the affected portion of the lobe is removed.","answer"

My situation was a double edge sword, I am not a large person I am a 6 ft male and weigh 164 pounds. My wife noticed one night that I would twitch very badly while I slept, that caused her to watch me one night and she noted several episodes of my arms and legs jumping around and at times she would see my trunk of my body would litterly jump in the air. During the time she was watching me she saw that I stopped breathing for long periods of time those times would last between 2 to 3 minutes in length of time. She would get so scared that she would shove me just to get me to start breathing again. After a few nights of this she forced me to go to the doctor because she could not sleep worring about if I would wake up. I remember having trouble even eating because my hands would shake so much that I had trouble holding on to my utensils. I went to the doctor and my wife went with me to make sure the doctor understood my symptoms. He told my wife that I can't have sleep apnea because I did not weigh enough to have that. Well my wife insisted that I be tested so I went through the sleep clinic and it showed I did have significant sleep apnea and I also had some other test where they flash lights in my eyes and that triggered many epileptic episodes. Now I take depakote and sleep with a CPAP machine, the combination of both have allowed me to get a nice restful sleep at night and I am not as tired in the morning when I get up. It is not perfect but it is much better than it was. As for the uncontolable twitches the depekote has settled it down but even that I have to keep modifing how much I take because of the side effects of the medication.Hope this was of help to you.Sincerely Ernie","answer"

My daughter had a closed head injury at the age of 3, which  resulted in multiple seizures (grand mal) and a heart arythmia. It seemed at first that she had epilepsy, and wsa trated for years on phenobarbitol, dilantin and Tegretol, none of which subsided the seizures. Then she was told she may have a vasal vagal reflux disorder, and that was triggering the seizures. she was taken off of the seizure medication and placed on inderol to control her heart. The seizures subsided, going from 2-3 a week to 2-3 per month, then slowing to 5 a year. Her doctor said she may outgrow them, or they could get worse during puberty. She will be 15 in June this year, and she has had 2 seizures in the last week. Her symptoms are first a severe sudden headache to the side of the head, and the feeling that someone is sitting on her chest and putting a pillow over her face. She says she can't breathe and gasps for air, then becomes unconscious and has grand mal seizures (tonic-clonic) with thrashing mostly on her right extremities. She is extremely tired after these episodes and wants to sleep for 2-3 hours afterwards. I have been told by doctors that these are ""breath holding"" spells. that she has ""learned"" to jerk for attention, and thatr her heart has nothing to do with the seizures. I know what a seizure is, she is not ""faking"" it, as a matter of fact she is unaware of what is happening until she wakes up, and even then she is confused for several minutes.

College could not deal with it.  She was disrupting class with EMT visits.  She had too many absence in her classes they could not give her credit.  She is back home and attending Community College.  It is not without challenge but state school has better system to deal with disability like hers.  I can sympathize with what you are going through.  Every test my daughter eveer took came out borderline.  Tilting test, Asthma, diabetes.  Our latest thing is visit to endocrinologist.  Few of the EMT has discovered her bloodsugar was very low when she had an episode.  But, not always.  We are trying to check if she is Hypoglycemic.  It involves 4 days of hospital stay on IV only.  They will bring down her bloodsugar to see how she reacts.  I am not 100% convinced to go through this since all the lab work came back normal and her blood sugar level looked ok.  My next step is Nurologist again.  Cardiologist thinks if it is nurological, she had many spisodes last 2 1/2 years, maybe they can now see some sort of damage.  We have been in and out of doctors office  local to far, No relief.  My daughter's life is in mass, family is always on alert.  I jump everytime my phone rings.  Only good news ot of this?  I met few people who a family member with same condition.  all has natural arrythmia had same symtoms with no relief from the medicines or diagnosis.  They are in their 40's.  Symtoms are gone.  It disappears as sudden as it came.  Now they all are married living a normal life.  That has been a final diagnosis for my daughter also from her EP.  It is a life time away for 18 years old.  If you come across some doctor or treatment, please share with me.","answer"

We sow are cathing these  Does your daughter drink very much,  we noticed our son is not drinking very much.  For about a week we pushed water on him, and the episodes went away, but now I am letting him do what he normally does because of this test scheduled.  I want to get him off this epilepsy meds if he doesn't need them, because they are not controlling his seizures.  The Cardiologist,and the articles I read said that some are misdiagnoised with epilepsy.  He also had Topomax added after the gran mal's started, and with all 3 meds at one time he still had gran mal's with exercise and showers. I am sorry for this being so lengthy, but yours is the first case that I have read that sounds like my sons.  Please let me know how your daughter's tilt table turns out.  Like your daughter his life has been totally changed and he can't drive as well, or play basketballl or track, which he loves.....and I too have felt so frustrated because the Pediatric neurologist recommended a Vagus Nerve Stimulatator, and really did not take time to listen as the cardiologist did.  Thanks","answer"

Temporal lobe epilepsy is a disorder which shows a vast range of symptoms. There are behavioral symptoms, sensory symptoms and many others. When you have the seizures, there has to be a structural change / damage to the brain tissue.

Temporal lobe epilepsy can also be triggered by stress. But it definitely does not cause the seizures. Regards","answer"

He had been on her computer and was drinking the same soft drink (he usually drinks water, or so he says, he IS in college).  He doesn't remember much about the incident, although he does remember the transfer into the ambulance.  His friend (not the most reliable reporter, I'm afraid) said that he complained of not feeling well and his hand jerked a couple of times as he held the computer mouse.   He does not remember having anything to eat prior to that, although he did eat the day before (at home, on Easter). I talked to him at the hospital about three minutes after he arrived, he appeared to be tired and cranky, but not disoriented at that time. On the ride home he complained of being a bit ""fuzzy"", though he could answer current event questions (and it was 2:00 a.m. and I can't say he's real great with current events on a good day).   A MRI and EEG were run about 24 hours post incident, with results wnl.His father and I are told that EEG's don't always test positive, even with seizure.  The neurologist (who I think is quite good) isn't accepting new patients until June.My question:  what to do?  Do we find another neurologist, and how does one go about doing that on short notice?  Do we start him on medication, even without a definitive diagnosis (do you always get a definitive diagnosis?)?  He has not driven since last Monday, and while we certainly certainly understand that this is the safest measure for him and others, how will we be able to measure efficacy of treatment with undiagnosed seizures a year apart?  It was recommended by a colleague (School Psych) that he have a sleep-induced EEG.  What do you think?  I'm reading on this forum that meds can CAUSE seizures.  Is taking the wrong action a risk?As a Speech-Language Pathologist (working in a public school, however, I don't claim to have top-notch clinical skills after eight years) I have rudimentary knowledge of the anatomy and brain function.  I have access to more.  We have decent insurance, and because he is a student, he is not limited by networks, etc.  We live in Western PA.This tired and scared mother is most appreciative of your time and expertise.","question"

We rushed her to emergency, but it took about ten minutes to get there and another ten for them to treat her symptoms before she stopped. She did not have a fever. She was given ativan and dilantin intravenously at this time. A CT scan returned negative. The next morning she was given 150 mg of dilantin and walked like a drunken sailor for the rest of the day (she weighs 20kg). We are waiting for an EEG and, in the meantime she has been prescribed phenobarbitol. This worries me. I had a few seizures as a child and grew out of them (I think I had benign rolandic epilepsy).  She is presently very very drowsy and napping for long stretches.

What is the LOWEST effective dose for a 100 lb girl (age 20). For example, could we actually leave her at the 250 mg at night and 125 mg in the morning?  250 mg. at night only? 500 mg at night only? Can she end up with just nightly doses?  2. What are, if any, POSITIVE side effects with keppra (i.e. lamictral can actually HELP with bipolar disorder). 3. Will the fatigue eventually go away as she is on it longer? 4. Of your patients, what percentage complain about their moods of depression, hostility, aggression, infection, etc.?  Also, what percentage say their moods are actually smoother with keppra? I very much appreciate reading your responses to all four questions. Thanks so much.","question"

There have been reports of effective seizure control from patients following up monthly. They are using Levetiracetam (Keppra) as an adjuvant to another first line anti-epileptic medication. Most of them are suffering from partial seizures. And the first line drug is mostly Tegretol. Only a few patients have complained about mood swings so far. All had predominantly depressed mood, but not to the extent of being called depressive disorder. This must be about 10% of the patients. The rest have no issues with mood. Almost one third of the rest are of the opinion that Levetiracetam has worked as a mood stabilizer for them. Keep in mind, these are reports from patients who are not diagnosed with any mood disorder such as bipolar disorder. Your daughter will have to receive the minimum effective dose of 900mg, as per her weight (45 kg). Having said that, she may respond to 500mg. I guess she is not receiving any other medicine. She will have to take the medicine in divided doses initially. We can think of stabilizing it to a night dose eventually once the seizures are controlled effectively. As far as the fatigue is concerned, I can not say how much more time it will take, but once the therapeutic concentration is achieved, fatigue may start reducing. This is expected to occur over the next couple of weeks. Regards","answer"

For 4.5 years I am struggling with losses of consciousness. I had several MRIs and EEGs done. Apart from cavum septi pellucidi (which was NOT considered to be the cause of my problems either by radiologists or neurologists) no irregularity was found. EEGs did not indicate any paroxysmal outbursts. In 2004 I underwent thorough diagnostic examinations in Vienna, Austria. The longest periods between losses of consciousness were 9.5 months; 8.5 months and 5 months. Now the periods between attacks have decreased to 3; 2 and 1 month between attacks. Initially under therapy with Lamictal, then Lamictal and Valproic Acid (both excluded by physicians in Vienna as they attributed my problems to job related stress). Roughly a year and a half ago prescribed diazepam pills a 5 mg 1,1,1 to be supplemented, six months ago, by Tegretol CR (controlled release) 0,0,1 (initially 400 mg, now 600 mg per day, after liver and EMIT tests). During the past 4.5 years I have bitten my tongue on two occasions, both times laterally and while asleep. In 90% of cases the losses of consciousness were experienced while seated (having lunch, twice in the car – as a passenger), behind laptop etc. A feeling (aura?) usually precedes the attack (?). It manifests as a special (hard to describe) feeling in the area of diaphragm and xiphoid process. In most cases my shoulders were slouched and I was exercising unintentional pressure on my abdomen. Witnesses estimated the loss of consciousness to last between 15 and 60 seconds where I would first turn pale (white as a sheet) and just before regaining consciousness my face would turn intensely red.

Neurodermatitis syndromes are known to be associated with seizures. I don't see the tongue biting episodes as normal incidences. Stress does play a role in ""triggering"" certain neurological issues, especially seizures. But stress is not the root cause. Your ""seizures"" appear to be related to changes in the blood circulation. The unintentional pressure on the abdomen alters the pressures in the chest cavity, which pushes blood out of the mediastinum. And you also turn pale during the episode. Had it not been for the tongue biting, I would also not have considered seizures. Regards","answer"

This has happened only on these two occasions. I have never had any heart problems. During the above mentioned examinations in Vienna I underwent ECG tests (including 24 hrs recording) plus ultrasound examination of the heart and periphery blood vessels (neck and feet). All findings were normal. As a background info: I am a nonsmoker and a nondrinker and have never used any drugs; I was involved in sports almost my entire life; I am 6.2'' and weigh between 195 and 198 lbs. All of the losses of consciousness occurred in relation to some stressful episode (tight deadlines at work, VIP visits at work, unresolved private issues etc.). I admit that I tend to set the bar rather high when it comes to my work performance as well as private life. The Vienna physicians concluded that stress was triggering these episodes. I argued that I had been exposed to a fair share of stress throughout my life but never with such results. However, they emphasized the cumulative nature of stress and warned me against underestimating the negative effects of stress. If it is of any value to you another piece of information: I suffer and have been suffering all my life from neurodermatitis which did not result in any serious problems but in situations when I am exposed to stress tends to visibly worsen and needs ointment treatment. Could it be that stress is the root cause of my problems?    I highly appreciate your time and effort.","answer"

I would need your opinion on another related issue. I am afraid that I may have been misdiagnosed and have been reading up, for quite some time now, on the possible different causes of my condition. This is when I started focusing on syncope as a possible cause of my problems. However, I do not know if I am able, as a patient, to maintain objectivity. Nonetheless, a number of symptoms fit this diagnosis: pallor, bradycardia, drop in blood pressure, losses of consciousness of under 60 seconds, epigastric discomfort, the fact that I am aware of my surroundings and fully oriented the moment I regain consciousness, the fact that I never recall hitting the ground (or sofa), normal EEGs, the fact that I was not taking any medications when I was problem free for periods of 8.5 and 9.5 months etc. I underwent head-up tilt test in 2005 but the result was negative. I know that it is not an easy job to differentiate between these conditions but I would hate to discover that I was being stuffed with medications that had nothing to do with my condition.

The abdominal pressure is actually part of the aura. I do not think your posture is related. Now the episodes are occurring more frequently.

If the nerve fibers coming from that area are affected, you get the pronator drift. Right frontal lobe controls the left side of the body. Hence, your pronator drift on the left becomes significant. The lesions shown on the MRI are in the white matter. Lesions in white matter affect the nerve fibers coming from the cortex. It is possible that the nerve fibers coming from the motor cortex are affected. There is no doubt that the VEEG and MEG reports suggest focal temporal lobe seizures. The question is what causes the seizures. If MS has been ruled out, what else? I am not able to provide you with a diagnosis at present. But I hope we can have a better understanding of the condition. You have mixed motor and sensory features. Two-point discrimination is a sensory dysfunction. The nerve fibers are arranged close to the nerves coming from the motor area. Since you have these on one side, I suspect the lesions shown in the MRI are the cause. You could think of small vessel problem. Do you have hypertension? Did you have any transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) in the recent past? Regards","answer"

Referring to your question in the very first post in this thread, the MRI findings of MS are not so vague as to be confused by any other lesions. There are deep white matter lesions (foci of hyperintense signal), which are periventricular. There are criteria for diagnosis on the MRI. You need to have a certain minimum as far as the lesions go. Did they do only a lumber spine MRI? When you also have upper limb symptoms, was a cervical cord MRI suggested? You have hyper-reflexia on the left and loss of pin-***** sensation on the right. This means that you have motor symptoms (weakness) and sensory symptoms (hyper-reflexia and loss of pin). For you to have these symptoms, your brain needs a widespread lesion. As you go down the brainstem into the spinal cord, all these fibers are clumped together, so that even a small lesion somewhere higher up in the cord can produce the same symptoms. Regards","answer"

Multiple thin section T1 and T2 weighted and STIR sagittal images were obtained of the lumbar spine as well as multiple thin section T1 and T2 weighted axial images from L1 through S1 with no prior exam available for comparison. Question, if they weren't suspecting MS would they even look for lesions or plaque?","answer"

Throughout the description, I have not seen any indication of a seizure. The spasms that you describe seem to be sustained contraction of the muscles and you seem to be alert and conscious during such an episode. Please correct me if I am wrong.There is no mention of an EEG. I suppose the MRI picture suggested MS. Your symptoms are varied. A common and long standing symptom is weakness and fatigue. For someone who types so fast, not being able to type is significant. I was wondering if you had any cervical cord MRI for any suspected lesions. Regards","answer"

My kids remark on how clumsy I am with dropping things, tripping myself.Summer 2005-Still having the heaviness in my legs, having periods of dizziness, it comes on fast and I am weak afterwards. The fatigue is back with the shock sensations.Winter 05-06-Legs still are heavy, had episode at work w/numbness and spasms in my neck and down my shoulder and arm, it lasted two weeks. Work is difficult, I can't type or concentrate.Feb 2006-Fatigue is becoming a battle for me, this time it lasted 2 months.Spring 2006-The heaviness in my legs make it quite a challenge at work, I walk 12 miles a day there and it is getting painful now.Summer 2006-The intolerance to heat is back along with the dizziness. I have started falling down, my concentration level is down, started having migraines, they always start in my right eye, I cannot move my head without it hurting even more, my vision is distorted as well.  The leg heaviness and weakness is constant.Winter 06-07-The cold is making me stiff and rigid, the fatigue is back am starting to miss a lot of work. The shock sensations are back. Having a hard time making quick decisions at work, its a hazard because I'm responsible for hundreds of thousands of dollars.

Having bizarre who body spasms, I lock up completely, I lose control of my bladder when this happens, I am having memory problems, it has gotten so bad that in mid-sentence I don't remember what I was talking about.Dr. Abhijeet, it just doesn't make sense that a seizure disorder could cause all of these symptoms.

I have mild scoliosis and livedo reticularis. I have had 2 children, one born prematurely, she had jaundice due to rh incompatability.  I have had every bloodwork known to man and besides having the ebv present in my blood, everything was normal.

I can not see any element of a seizure. But it will help if you can me provide with the timeline. Do you have a weblink?Since you do not lose consciousness and appear to have the spasms pretty constant, I do not suspect a seizure. I may be wrong. A detailed history would help. Regards","answer"

The way to best describe them are severe spasms and muscle ridgity. I cannot bend over anymore and walking is painful. The spasms have drawn my right leg up so I have to swing it when I walk.  I do fall down a lot, my right leg is so numb sometimes I don't feel the ground beneath it.  I have been taking 800mg of gabapentin 3x/day and have for 3-4 years.  I have had two EEG's so far and they have been normal.  I am to have another one soon.  I made a timeline if you are interested in seeing it, the neuro I seen didn't want to be bothered with it.Thank You so much for replying to me, it makes a world of difference. You are wonderful.Spastic","answer"

A seizure is defined as an episode of central nervous system dysfunction. A seizure may or may not be accompanied by convulsions. Your seizures are unusual. Do you lose consciousness when you have the episode? usually convulsions are tonic (only spasms) or tonic - clonic (spasms followed by repeated contractions). An EEG confirms a seizure. Has it been done? Regards","answer"
