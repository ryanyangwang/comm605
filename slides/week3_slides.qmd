# READINGS

## **Lazer et al. (2009)**:

-   Opportunities: individual, group, and societal level collected by new technologies and analyzed by new methods
-   Challenges:
    -   new paradigms needed for the massive dataset?
    -   institutional obstacle?
    -   data access and privacy issue

## **Hilbert et al. (2019)**

-   Paradigm change?
    -   Observational
    -   Theoretical research
    -   Experimental
-   Questions:
    -   More data is good data?
    -   New tools but new theories?
    -   Ethical issues?
    -   [Resources](https://sicss.io/)

## **Aichner et al. (2021)** {.smaller}

-   What is social media -- compared to mass media

    -   Online platform: blogs, business networks, collaborative projects, enterprise social networks, forums, microblogs, photo sharing, products review, social bookmarking, social gaming, SN, video sharing, and virtual worlds.

-   What do social media do?

    -   Socializing/Romance
    -   Interacting with government/politicians/companies/brands
    -   Job seeking and professional networking
    -   Business

-   How would you define it?

## **Road map** (for next two weeks)

-   

    ### What is Computational Communication Science?

-   

    ### What data is out there?

-   

    ### How to utilize the data?

## What is CCS? {.smaller}

-   Communication as a field has put less emphasis on methodologies

> "...lack of methods for the study of \[communication\] process and adoption of approaches from other fields"[^1]

[^1]: Poole, M. S. (2007). Generalization in process theories of communication. *Communication Methods and Measures*, *1*(3), 181-190.

-   Definition of Computational Communication Science (if we ever need one)?

> An application of computational science to questions of human and social communication"[^2]

[^2]: Hilbert, M., Barnett, G., Blumenstock, J., Contractor, N., Diesner, J., Frey, S., ... & Zhu, J. J. (2019). Computational communication science: A methodological catalyzer for a maturing discipline. *International Journal of Communication*, *13*, 3912-3934.

## What is CCS?

-   A subfield of Computational Social Science [^3]

    -   large and complex data sets;
    -   consisting of digital traces and other "naturally occurring" data;
    -   requiring algorithmic solutions to analyze;
    -   allowing the study of human communication by applying and testing communication theory.

## What data is out there?

::: columns

### Digital trace / Social media data
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Administrative record

-   Tax records
-   School records
-   Phone call records

## What kinds of social media data?

-   Twitter: text & network
-   Instagram: image & text
-   Youtube: image/video & text

## How can we utilize social media data?

## How can we utilize social media data?

-   

    ### Measurement

    -   Automatic content analysis

-   

    ### Inference

    -   Explanatory modeling
    -   Predictive modeling

## Characteristics of *big data*

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
### PRO

-   BIGNESS
-   ALWAYS-ON
-   NONREACTIVE
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
### CON

-   INCOMPLETE
-   INACCESSIBLE
-   NONREPRESENTATIVE
-   DRIFTING
-   ALGORITHMICALLY CONFOUNDED
-   DIRTY AND NOISY
-   SENSITIVE (potential harm?)
:::
:::

## IS COMPUTATIONAL APPROACH A ONE-FOR-ALL SOLUTION?

### ABSOLUTELY NOT!

-   Big data hubris? "Big" data does not mean "Good" data
-   Valid and reliable measurement?
    -   Validation matters
-   Interpretable machine learning?
    -   The good-for-prediction vs. The good-for-explanation
-   Ethics: the fairness of machine learning
    -   Algorithmic bias -- annotation matters!
    -   Case: large language models, toxicity detection
