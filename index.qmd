### Course overview

This is the tutorial website for COMM 605 *Social media analytics and research* at Rochester Institute of Technology. All the codes in the tutorials are created by the instructor and open access resources, including but not limited to:

-   Wickham, H., √áetinkaya-Rundel, M., & Grolemund, G. (2023). [*R for data science (2nd version)*](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/).
-   Liang, H. [*COMM3650: Social Media Analytics for Communication Professionals*](https://drhailiang.com/teaching/COMM3650).
-   van Atteveldt, W., Trilling, D. & Calder√≥n, C. A. (2022). [*Computational Analysis of Communication*](https://v2.cssbook.net/)
-   The [blog](https://kateto.net/blog/) of Dr. Katya Ognyanova
-   The [lab](https://github.com/jdfoote/com_and_social_networks_labs) of Dr. Jeremy Foote

This course focuses on social media research with various methodological approaches to study public data, users and messages. Students will be introduced to a variety of techniques and concepts used to obtain, monitor and evaluate social media content with a focus on how the analytics could inform communication strategies. During the course, students will also learn how to design and evaluate social media-based research studies.

### Objectives

Students who successfully complete assigned coursework should develop the following skills:

-   explain the theoretical and methodological perspectives that guide social media research;
-   apply computational tools and practice basic data science skills to answer empirical research questions and conduct social science research;
-   identify major milestones in social media platforms and research;
-   critique on how algorithms and (social media)data may affect civil societies in both positive and adverse ways.
