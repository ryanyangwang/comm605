# READINGS

## Lukito et al. (2023)

Definition of *digital media data*: data that are collected, extracted, gathered, or scraped from a web-based platform such as a website, social networking site, mobile application, or another online space.

-   Digital life data (e.g., text, image, and videos)
-   Digital trace data (e.g., timestamp, author information, social media metrics)
-   Digitized data (e.g., books, radio recordings, and broadcasts shared online)

## Text-as-data: natural language processing {.smaller}

Main goal for social scientists:

-   feature extraction (variable)
-   feed the features into statistical modeling

Methods:

-   Supervised machine learning (classification of text): BERT model
    -   hate speech, conspiracy theory, framing, sentiment, toxicity, personality
-   Unsupervised machine learning: topic modeling
    -   Discourse/theme...
-   Dictionary-based approach: custom-made dictionaries, LIWC, VADER
    -   emotion, sentiment

::: notes
The polarized discourses on Twitter about Gillette's campaign on toxic masculinity (Xu & Xiong, 2020) The global LGBTQ CSR discourse in Fortune Global 500 companies' annual report

## Image/Video-as-data

![Peng, Y., Lu, Y., & Shen, C. (2023). An Agenda for Studying Credibility Perceptions of Visual Misinformation. Political Communication, 40(2), 225-237.](/image/cv.png)

## Image/Video-as-data {.smaller}

-   Zero-shot model (i.e., Microsoft's Azure Face API):
    -   Facial detection/recognition (gender, age)
        -   The links between personalities and number of faces in the respondents' Instagram accounts (Kim & Kim, 2018)
    -   Emotion detection
        -   Facial expression emotions in credibility perception of a crisis management (Stephens et al., 2019)
    -   Aesthetic features: brightness, contrast, composition, color, texture, blur, and complexity (image entropy)
        -   How do the environmental characteristics (colors, luminance, and saturation, style)inspire consumers to engage in creating and posting environment-cued indirect advertising (Campell et al., 2022)
-   Supervised machine learning:
    -   Violence in political protest
-   Unsupervised machine learning:
    -   Image clustering

::: notes
Multi-modal data
:::

## Audio-as-data

Vocal pitch as measurement of emotional intensity in legislators' speech when mentioning about women (Dietrich et al. 2019)

## Network-as-data

-   Descriptive analysis
    -   Community detection
    -   Network centrality (i.e., opinion leader)
-   Inferential analysis
    -   How do nodal and dyadic features influence the emergence of edge/link
        -   Exponential Random Graph Model (ERGM): cross-sectional network
        -   Stochastic actor-oriented model (SAOM) or SIENA model: longitudinal network

## New methods? Old methods? {.smaller}

Research methods:

-   Observational research
    -   Linking survey data and digital trace data
-   Experiment
    -   Virtual lab experiment (e.g., apps/web as labs)
    -   Virtual field experiment ([Bail et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1804840115))
-   Algorithm auditing
-   Simulation

How does theory fit in?

-   Framing ([Chen et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.1177/19401612221106405))
-   Agenda-setting ([Vargo et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.1177/1461444817712086))
-   Two-step flow model/networked-step flow model ([Hilbert et al., 2017](https://doi.org/10.1177/0894439316639561))
-   Selective exposure ([Song & Boomgaarden, 2017](https://doi.org/10.1111/jcom.12288))

# Case study: TikTok

::: notes
Why TikTok - it is multimodal data: text, image/video, audio, network
:::

## Serrano et al. (2020) {.smaller}

::: incremental
Data collection:

-   hashtags: #republican and #democrat on February 1, 2020
-   original videos of above
-   videos using the same audio clip
:::

::: incremental
Data types:

-   Video
    -   Audio
-   Caption
-   Interaction: duet
:::

::: incremental
Measurement and data analysis:

-   Manual labeling: Pro-democrat/Pro-republican/Non-partisan
-   Face detection (Microsoft's Azure Face API): emotion, gender, age
-   Audio (speech-to-text): topic modeling
-   Caption: topic modeling
-   Duet: Intra-partisan or cross-partisan interaction
:::

## Kim et al. (2023) {.smaller}

::: incremental
Data collection (through Junkipedia):

-   anti-vaccination keywords (e.g., #abolishbigpharma, #arrestbillgates)
:::

::: incremental
Data types:

-   Video: Audio/Transcript
-   Caption
:::

::: incremental
Measurement:

-   Emotion
    -   Face emotion detection (thumbnails): fear, anger, and happiness
    -   Emotion detection (caption and transcript): Dictionary based analysis (NRC)
-   Identity
    -   A list of vocabularies signifying partisanships (e.g., Republicans, Democrats), socio-cultural identities (e.g., Asian, child, doctor), different age groups (e.g., old, young, GenZ), and ideological identities (e.g.,liberal, conservative)
    -   Count the words associated with each identity in TikTok captions and transcripts
-   TikTok engagement
    -   number of shares, number of comments, and number of likes
:::

## Kim et al. (2023) {.smaller}

### Data analysis:

-   (negative binominal) Regression
    -   Engagement as the dependent variables
    -   Emotion and identity cues as the independent variables
        -   Message multimodalities

            -   Emotions in video captions, transcripts, and thumbnails
            -   Identities in video captions and transcripts
            -   Interaction effect (affective polarization)
