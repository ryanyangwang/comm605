"Time for an UPDATE and analysis of what has come about and revealed since this video was made.  There was a glaring omission of Fauci in the video.  I remember him saying early on that this ""was like the flu"".  I want to know what Trump was being told in their meetings and briefings.  He went against their recommendations and shut down the travel from China early on.  In and interview with Fauci when asked about Trump and his response and actions to the outbreak, he said it was ""impressive"".   Now I see where the CDC and some hospitals are calling for the use of HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE  and IVERMECTIN in their protocol.  Also the effects of mRNA.  There are a lot of questions to be answered still.  My biggest question, is why did China allow travel out of their country after the New Year celebration if they knew this virus was out there.

It might have actually just gone away like Trump said it would. Instead he was more concerned about the pending election and the stock market than he was about human life.

"This video should be pulled by the NY Times for conflating opinion and science regarding a sensitive issue where the public needs all the facts it can get. This video drives forward the idea that lockdowns are a magic bullet solution and that the US's high number of covid deaths are mainly the result of the US not locking down.  Here is a well-cited peer reviewed journal article by Allen (2021), which uses far more rigor and faces far more accountability than, somewhat understandably, we get from this video journalist opinion piece, saying the exact opposite: ""An examination of over 100 Covid-19 studies reveals that many relied on false assumptions that over-estimated the benefits and under-estimated the costs of lockdown. The most recent research has shown that lockdowns have had, at best, a marginal effect on the number of Covid-19 deaths. Generally speaking, the ineffectiveness stemmed from individual changes in behavior: either non-compliance or behavior that mimicked lockdowns. The limited effectiveness of lockdowns explains why, after more than one year, the unconditional cumulative Covid-19 deaths per million is not negatively correlated with the stringency of lockdown across countries... It is possible that lockdown will go down as one of the greatest peacetime policy failures in modern history.""  This opinion video wholly ignores the inconvenient truth that lockdowns have their own negative consequences that can outweigh the benefits.  Of course, we should hold Trump responsible for his mixed messaging and anti-science rhetoric/policies.  We should also acknowledge that the issue of lockdown efficacy is a complex one, and it's easy for someone like me who is well off and has a partner and has a job that can go online to say we should all lockdown and cast judgement on those who disagree.

"Jan 31st , 2020 - Trump implemented travel restrictions from China .
.
Feb 1st , 2020 , the next day , Joe Biden tweeted ‚ÄúWe are in the midst of a crisis with the coronavirus. We need to lead the way with science ‚Äî not Donald Trump‚Äôs record of hysteria, xenophobia, and fear-mongering. He is the worst possible person to lead our country through a global health emergency.‚Äù
.
March 12, 2020 Joe Biden tweeted, ‚ÄúA wall will not stop the coronavirus. Banning all travel from Europe ‚Äî or any other part of the world ‚Äî will not stop it. This disease could impact every nation and any person on the planet ‚Äî and we need a plan to combat it. ‚Äù OK - so Biden said keep the border open .

In this video , journalist Nick Christophe states ""  One of the basic things about this pandemic is that , if people really do take it seriously , and for 4 weeks or 6 weeks adhere to stay at home orders .... then the virus is stopped in its tracks . ""

Nick Christophe's has presented a false argument , because in order to stop transmission in the US , 
the US border would need to be shut indefinitely ,
AND all citizens would need to simultaneously go into quarantine for a few weeks .

What this NY Time hit piece fails to say is that Operation Warp Speed was initiated circa April 29th , 2020 .

Trump's comments did not help - He should have been telling Americans to isolate as much as possible , 
especially in densely populated cites.
However Trump , attempted to stop the virus from entering the US and initiated the development of a vaccine .

This short is clearly biased and wants to blame Trump (who I am NOT a fan of and never voted for and never would for the record) for everything. Shutting down had deleterious down sides, so I'm not one to champion it unless you think the suicide rate of children skyrocketing is a really great thing.

"Could we as a country have handled it better, absolutely. There were many areas we failed that we shouldn't have and yes President Trump bears some of the blame. BUT At the same time, you cannot talk about COVID like it was the black plague, like we failed completely because it was this extremely deadly virus we just didn't bother to acknowledge, that is a completely disingenuous position to take. The real data we had, showed that many millions of people under a certain age that didn't have comorbidities, were not nearly as at risk as an overweight person in their mid 60's. Had this entire thing not become political, we could have done a better job at fighting the virus while preserving our economy and our personal rights. We are STILL feeling the effects with inflation and all of the shortages because of the lockdowns we put the country through. Those had a devastating effect on the country, on ALL Americans, regardless of age or immunity to the virus. It got political and as soon as that happened, no one was listening to anyone. The left wanted to lock everyone and everything down for an unspecified amount of time and completely take over the entire country with the force of government control, constitutional rights and freedoms be damned. The right decided the virus wasn't serious at all to an extent and refused to get vaccinated (which is their choice anyway), and developed a rebellious attitude toward the public effort of trying to fight the virus. Both sides in my view are too blame for making it a political issue when it didn't need to be. It could have been an amazing opportunity to unite together in good faith and fight the virus together. But it wasn't, and COVID is still being used as a political tool by the current administration to pass student loan forgiveness, an action the executive branch has no authority to take.

Sadly I believe one of the worst things we did was state that we were taking a liberal approach on diagnosing covid deaths.

Rush a vaccine as quickly as possible after the public knowing that vaccines take quite some time to produce safely then telling them they have to take it.
Politicians who didnt wear masks, kept restaurants open and had maskless gatherings.
Wearing masks that dont prevent viruses.
Reporting that pfizer missed its mark on revenue from their vaccine, proving there was money to be made on a pandemic and proving the vaccine was equally a product to make money as well as a treatment.
Vaccines being a product is incredibly risky to those who are forced to consume it.

"JOE BIDEN WROTE AN OP ED IN USA TODAY IN JANUARY OF 2020 titled: Trump is worst possible leader to deal with coronavirus outbreak

""To be blunt, I am concerned that the Trump administration‚Äôs shortsighted policies have left us unprepared for a dangerous epidemic that will come sooner or later.

Pandemic diseases are a prime example of why international cooperation is a requirement of leadership in 2020. Diseases do not stop at borders. They cannot be thwarted by building a wall. We cannot keep ourselves safe without helping to keep others safe as well and without enlisting the help of other nations in return. And here‚Äôs the truth ‚Äî the United States must step forward to lead these efforts, because no other nation has the resources, the reach or the relationships to marshal an effective international response.""

""That‚Äôs how we broke the infection curve on Ebola. In September 2014, CDC projections warned that over 1 million people could be infected if we failed to act. By February 2015, thanks to the leadership of our administration, the number of new Ebola cases was fewer than 400.

We live with several comorbidities with medicines keeping us alive.  The virus defeated what science gave us.  

Each one of us has the responsibility to avoid diseases.  It is not the governments.  My doctor's advice was clean hands which I followed.  My wife and I did not lock down and avoided masks where they were not  required.  If you avoid crowds you could avoid the virus.

"This video is so unbelievable. So much propoganda. The reason the United States had the highest number of cases is because we had the highest per capita testing in the whole entire world and were only surpassed by Italy alone, in the beginning of December 2021. The more testing you do the more diagnosis is you are going to get. As far as death certificates listing COVID-19 reports have shown that many of these people died with covid not from covid. That is not to minimize the seriousness of covid but to act like it was the only factor is disingenuous. Trump did operation warp speed for the vaccine and declared a state of emergency but yet he gave up? The states that had the strictest covid-19 measures of masking and quarantining had barely marginal better outcomes and that is so multifactorial regarding city density and age of population. You act like if we all would have just stayed home and not gone anywhere for 2 weeks this virus would have gone away. The only way that could have happened is if everyone in the world stayed in their homes for two whole weeks, we banned international travel, no doctors or nurses anywhere... One single case gets out and boom it starts all over again so this type of messaging takes advantage of infallible outcomes because they are outcomes you can't 'disprove' so you could say that we could have stopped the virus but you know very well that is inaccurate. There had to be a first case here in America in order for it to grow to the level that it did so again unless everyone stayed home perfectly for two weeks straight (and hopefully they all had enough food in their houses... And no firefighters or doctors or nurses going anywhere!) then you are chasing ghosts with this argument. The high number of deaths also correlates to testing. Do you really think there were less covid-19 deaths in the slums of India than there was in America or is that because they didn't test all of their deaths? Propaganda is using stats that benefit you to make your point and that is exactly what you did here. Years from now when we see the deaths of despair, obesity from staying indoors, domestic violence and child abuse, lost jobs, increased substance abuse... Are you going to be open to someone making a video identical to this blaming the overzealous response of making the cure worse than the disease? Probably not because you can say that those aren't directly tied to covid-19 because there's no way to put covid-19 as the cause of death on any of those aforementioned issues. Cool motivating music in the background though and nice play on showing pictures of people who have passed away to tug on heart strings in order to make everyone angry at Trump.

"@TheDankLord 
If you look at the places in Sweden with low population density you still see lower numbers of deaths than in Swedens neighbouring countries with comparable population density.
In my home province J√§mtland have 130.280 people. 32.492 people have tested positive. Of those have 168 died. 
That gives you a 0.009% risk of dying among those who tested positive.
I don't think that is much. I don't think this is the new bubonic plague.
I don't think this number justifies all hysteria with lockdowns, facemasks, and vaccination bullying. All internet censorship all crashing of the economy.

Furthermore I would argue that these numbers presented are also probably exaggerating the problem in J√§mtland.
Many who have got infected with Covid don't even know that they had the disease because they had so mild symptoms, so the risk of dying is therefore probably even lower than what my calculation suggest.
And furthermore have treatments been improved over the last two years so the risk of dying have been reduced with over 75% here in Sweden. So those earlier higher death numbers are probably not true for today.",Nattygsbord,2022-03-28T22:08:07Z

I know of a close friend who doctors were demanding she be vaxed, all her family was beating her up for it, she got covid and realized after extentisive testing she possessed a rare platelette disorder. Had she been vaccinated, there is a strong chance the vaccine could have killed her. However, she fought through covid and lived instead and now has natural immunity which is stronger than anything the MRNA vax can provide because its based around the spike protein which mutates constantly and not the nucleocapsid which hardly mutates at all by comparison, and nucleocapsids are present in traditional vaccines.

your thesis  is simplistic. I think the real reason why there were so many deaths in the US vs the EU is because of the required implementation of the intubation early on. Doctor's were saying that that type of treatment would not have been normally recommended with the symptoms that were presented. The US was too aggressive with their use. Basically they freaked out. Another thing to think about is that americans would rather be free and die than to be like socialistic EU and be locked up and live.,S,2022-01-07T20:52:37Z

"As a former scientist myself, I believe the answer to your initial question is that our medical institutions and government do NOT follow the evidence and conclusions of the latest scientific information. I have read some of the internal studies done at the NIH, for example, on the efficacy of iver mectin as a prophylactic against Covid infection. The small internal study, done on frontline Covid healthcare workers, suggests it is highly effective. This is also suggested by the central African Covid numbers. However, our health officials and politicians took a strong stance against this drug, and now are unwilling to publically back down and admit they were wrong. The recent Bangladeshi mask study is another case in point. I would happily wear a mask if that mask is effective. But the study shows that only certain types of masks are effective ‚Ä¶ so THOSE masks should be advocated, and it should be pointed out that other masks don‚Äôt work well. As it is, the people are deluded into using the wrong type of protective equipment. Germany, for example, issued all citizens an N95 mask (according to my sister, a former medical worker). Perhaps that explains the discrepancy in infection rates. The other possible explanation is a difference in testing and recording ‚Ä¶ but that is just my speculation, so take the suggestion with a dose of skepticism. As to Sweden ‚Ä¶ well, they are to story onto themselves.",Dilvish PA,2022-01-07T11:20:35Z

"I find it very heart-breaking that in my own country, India, our Prime Minister took the difficult decision of completely shutting down the economy and successfully moved past the first wave, but, is called a failure because he got complacent thinking there will be no second wave.

I think not being prepared for the second wave was unforgivable. But, the first wave was handled surprisingly well. Although, he had all the access to the science, our healthcare system was so poorly prepared from the beginning. It seems like sheer incompetence he hadn't expedited resource planning for our healthcare system.

But, watching this makes me think that our country did many times better in the first wave. Our country has a population that is 3 times larger, but, has half the casualties is not a correct justification. I am looking at the approach now.

"This New York Times video documentary blames President Trump and other US leaders, including Democrats like Bill de Blasio, for high infections and deaths from COVID-19. This was published in September 2020, and it didn't age well. For example, they based their claim in part on Europe overall having better results, but things were quite bad in Italy, Spain, France, and the UK. There were times when Europe was worse than the US. Some of the European countries they presented as good examples eventually became serious pandemic hotspots. 



We know now that more Americans have died post-Trump than during the Trump era, even though Trump's vaccines weren't widely available until post-Trump. That's not to blame Biden. The virus doesn't care who your president, governor, and dominant political party are. The virus will do what it does regardless.

President Trump twice received intelligence briefings on the coronavirus in January, according to a White House official. The official tells NPR the briefings occurred on Jan. 23 and Jan. 28.

""The president was told that the coronavirus was potentially going to 'spread globally,' "" the official said of the first briefing, which came two days after the first case of the virus was reported in the United States. ""But the 'good news' was that it was not deadly for most people,"" the official said the president was told.

Five days after that initial briefing, the president was briefed again, according to the official. This time, he was told the virus ""was spreading outside of China, but that deaths from the disease were happening only in China,"" the official said. ""He was also told that China was withholding data.""

I suppose your definition of ‚Äúearly January‚Äù might be different from most people, but seriously, January 23 is ‚Äúearly January.‚Äù Since you are obviously lying about when President Trump was first briefed about the Chinese Bar Cold, it is reasonable to presume you are lying about when epidemiologists were ‚Äúall over this thing.‚Äù",oddjobbob,2021-11-24T01:22:50Z

He then banned Europe subsequently. CDC projected 2.2m deaths, so Trump saved around 1.8m lives. Also, there are now more deaths under Biden than Trump. Explain that Liberals. One had NO VACCINE, the other had a VACCINE FROM DAY ONE.

Moreover, the US had more deaths because they had an obesity epidemic. 70-80% of ICUs are obese. Over 90% of all covid deaths are old ppl n ppl with co-morbidities. Prove me wrong Libnuts!",J dubs,2021-11-23T04:14:45Z
"So, the doc is great, but there is some misinformation here. Mainly, shutting down is not proven to be effective against covid, not as much as other forms of prevention such as face masks or adequate hygiene. It can only delay the next wave (which in itself is important, sure). I live in Sweden, and if you look at the map, it shows we had very little shutting down, but our cases per capita are still lower better than France. There are many speculations on what are the different preventative and/ or exasperating factors, but I just want to point this out that just because something is popular, doesn't mean it's right or correct.",Badaryman!,2021-11-23T00:15:20Z

To blame this on Trump is ludicrous and short sighted, more political bs.

"I'd like to see how this video aged?

 Covid did not go away in Europe, like this video implies. 

And this video labels this as a plague? And a Pandemic. But was/is it even a pandemic? This video, I'm guessing, had an agenda to push, and went about looking for evidence that supported their agenda. They seemingly did not look at the facts and let the facts do the talking. The CDC came out and admitted that as high as 94% of deaths labeled as covid deaths could have been non-related to covid. 

I've heard that states like Florida, and South Dakota, who either never did any lockdowns or who opened back up sooner and/or for longer than other states, have some of the lowest covid rates right now? I've also heard that the science is saying that everyone will get covid, that there is no stopping it or getting rid of it, like the makers of this video seem to claim could have happened had we responded differently? Another aspect this video completely ignores is all of the indirect harm that comes from lockdowns and social distancing and extensive wearing of face masks. Suicides are way up, alcohol use is way up, depression is way up, crime is way up, the economy is suffering, and some negative effects won't be able to be measured until further down the line and some will have long lasting effects. I read one article that said deaths and the financial harm from things like lockdowns and such, could be well over 10 times what comes from covid. So the cure is hurting us worse than the disease. Trump warned about this. But the fear mongers won.",Jason Matthews,2021-11-21T21:11:38Z

do u take the vaccine?,Britnie Ashley,2021-11-22T02:59:57Z
"@Britnie Ashley No, I have not and most likely never will take the vaccine. Why would I? The Vaccinated are just as able to transmit the virus to someone else as the unvaccinated, in fact, they are probably MORE likely to transmit the virus to others as many of the general public believe that getting the vaccine protects you from getting the virus and/or protects others from getting it from you. Neither are true. Fully vaccinated people all over the world are getting covid, in fact the countries with the highest percentages of vaccinated citizens are the countries with some of the worst rates of people getting covid now. 

And I was watching Jimmy Dore and it was said on his show that the chance of an unvaccinated person needing to be hospitalized if they get covid is LESS than 1%, and the vast majority of that less than 1% have co-morbidities and/or are old and/or overweight. I'm not old, I'm not over weight, I'm quite healthy and I eat healthy, too. There is no need for me to get the vaccine and by doing so becoming dependent upon continually more vaccines/boosters every six months or so for the rest of my life.

"@One of a Person Dude, not sure where you are from, but hopefully you have the freedom to fall for the fear mongering if you want to live in fear. I'm just trying to point out the FACTS and the lies and the corruption and the deceptions, etc.. The Super Rich is getting richer because of people being afraid, and the fear mongering leftist news media is cooperating with them, probably because those super rich making tons of money at the populace's expense are most likely funding those media outlets. Bill Gates gives hundreds of millions, probably billions of dollars to media organizations, and he gave a bunch of money to the University that wanted to give out their covid vaccine info for free, so he was able to pressure them not to do that, so instead it got patented and now poor countries have to go without vaccines so that Bill Gates can make more money, as if he doesn't have enough? 

And maybe you've seen one of those videos that highlight just how many shows out there are sponsored by Pfizer? It's a ton of them. So Big Pharma pays for good coverage and the people getting that money are biased to protect their leftist politician friends who you know are funded by Big Pharma so they make laws and say things publicly that promote Big Pharma so-called solutions. It's one big circle of rich people helping to enrich each other all at the expense of the masses who they could care less about.

Nor does this story start in 2005, or even in 1917 with the ill-named Spanish Flu outbreak.  Pandemics have plagued the human race throughout its existence.  The problem started in 2016, when Trump took office and ignored the warnings of his predecessors, just as Bush ignored Clinton's warnings about al Qaeda.  This video provides a pretty decent synopsis, except it omits some key fatal mistakes made under the Trump administration prior to the emergence of Covid-19.

"By the time Toxic Trump left office, around one out of every 800 Americans had died from COVID-19 in the span of only ten months, as many U.S. casualties as all of WWII--most of those deaths due to the Traitor-'n-Thief and Republican's lies, gross incompetence, and homicidal criminal negligence.  U.S. total fatalities for 2020 were double that of previous years.  Only one facet of Trump's ""American carnage.""

"The Vietnam Veterans Memorial (VVM, or ‚Äúthe Wall‚Äù) is dedicated not to the war, but to the 2.7 million U.S. military men and women who served in the war zone, living and dead.  It contains nearly 58,300 names of those dead or missing, on two ten-foot high granite wings, each spanning nearly 250 feet.  A close uncle‚Äôs name is etched into the black rock of the Wall.  

Propose erecting a similar monument for all those who senselessly lost their lives to COVID-19 due to our Traitor-‚Äòn-Thief, Toxic Trump, and all those Republican so-called ‚Äúleaders‚Äù in Congress, SCOTUS, and the GOP, along with Reich-wing demagogues and media, who were complicit in enabling, aiding, and abetting his malfeasance, and in spreading disinformation and misinformation.  In just four MONTHS, the U.S. had ALREADY needlessly lost more than TWICE as many to COVID-19 than died in all thirteen YEARS of the Vietnam war.   By the time Trump left office, one out of every 800 Americans had died from COVID-19 in just ten months--over 410,000 fatalities, as many American casualties as all of WWII.  To put it into further perspective, throughout Trump's catastrophic mishandling of a deadly global pandemic, the U.S. led the world in cases and deaths, suffering nearly 25% of each, despite having only 4.25% of global population, despite having the advantage of being the richest and most advanced nation in the world.  

The memorial would also honor all those front-line ESSENTIAL workers who selflessly put their lives on the line every day to keep us safe and secure; the names of their dead to be given prominence and note upon the structure.  Whether constructed in the form of a wall or something different, its principle intent would be to serve as a constant, enduring reminder to us all and to future generations; as a testament to‚Äîand a barrier against‚Äîour own American ignorance, arrogance, avarice, cowardice, and malevolence.  A sort of visual prophylactic, if you will, built in hope of protecting us against inbred hubris, greed, and stupidity.  It‚Äôs design should be open, with interchangeable elements that challenge‚Äîand help teach‚Äîpeople to reason, and to think critically and objectively, while stressing humanity, humility and humbleness.  

The VVM Wall is likewise also a monument to American ignorance, hubris, avarice, and malevolence, although erected solely to honor those military personnel.  Few may think, or have thought, of it that way; and doubtless many would refuse to think of it as such, but the truth stands out in stark, prominent display for everyone to see‚Ä¶if they just apply a little critical, objective reasoning.   

Another thought to ponder:  The VVM Wall marks the first time America fatally failed that generation; the proposed monument would mark our second time they were senselessly sacrificed.  Would like to see the proposed COVID-19 monument erected adjacent to the prior monument attesting failure, the VVM Wall, to serve as symbolic bookends, as a further tribute to that ill-served generation of Americans.",wily wascal,2021-11-19T16:23:50Z

And we all know how that turned out. (Hope it was worth it Donny boy, all those early hundred thousand deaths thanks to you, and your racist stupidity and disinformation, failure to listen and then blaming those that told you what you didn't want to hear, firing them and trying to marginalize, defame and disenfranchise them, who were only trying to give the American people the truth as they knew it AT A GIVEN MOMENT, regarding a virus that clearly did not know how to follow any rules and presented rapidly shifting challenges at nearly every turn.)

Then we were getting the reports, that, during the transition between the Obama and the Trump White houses, there was a conference about the presidential guided pandemic response where Trump quickly became bored because no one was talking about him or focusing on him, he got one of his first tastes that being president actually involved giving one's dedicated and concentrated attention to a variety of issues, some widely diverse, others interrelated. then I read that at the conference end Trump's entourage left all the materials, the hard copy materials on the conference table and someone else's aide had to run after them with them.

If I had known that at the time it happened, I would have known maybe a month or two before I did find out for sure, that America was hurtling at Mach 500k, into a world of hurt that's so far, seems at times to be terrifyingly irreversible.",Frenchblue8,2021-11-09T19:45:22Z

If people don't believe you, don't blame them because they are stupid. Blame yourselves because you are liars. 

BTW, the jump in cases is because people got vaccines and assumed they could stop social distancing. They couldn't, but didn't know that because the press lied. The vaccines weren't effective. 30% of vaccinated people still can get sick and spread the disease. Those 30% stopped social distancing. That's where the bump came from.

Fun fact: the CDC had an initiative to send 5 masks to every household in America via USPS. 5 white reusable masks packed and labeled with guidance and prepostmarked. Those masks never went out to households. They did go out to some essential businesses. My job still has some we use when we forget ours. It‚Äôs a weird feeling looking at the label and thinking about what could have been.,n feliciano,2021-09-15T00:17:54Z

Folks we have a pandemic on our hands and shot's are available that are over 90% effective against the ravages of Covid.  Only take the shot if you want to. Especially as there is not enough to go around for all the people. Bam!  Non vaccers will raid the stores and pharmacy's to hoard the shot, not to be left out. Kinda like hoarding toilet paper! Do you think those people would have hoarded toilet paper if they were told it was mandatory to buy up all the toilet paper or you will be arrested! No they would not. To get people to do the right thing in society you have to let it be their idea and play on their fear.

We knew exactly what to do about Polio before the George Bush administration claiming they were developing cell lines for medicine. We have a vaccine for all variants of coronavirus known as Salk vaccine. That was 60 years ago but we easily developed an antigen used in the swab test to diagnose coronavirus covid-19 infections. This antigen is a vaccine for Polio covid-19 SARS MERS all variants of coronavirus. We don't use the Salk vaccine or the antigen used in the tests. We find frozen vaccines that are suspiciously frozen and suggest the use of cell lines and may cause cancer.

"Watched as Trump purposefully allowed USA to die! He knew this was deadlier than the flu. Why did he dismantle the pandemic team? Why did he move the stockpile, and where did it go? Trump should be shot for treason. He defrauded the country as he was commiting criminal acts for his own enrichment. He doesn't even know the constitution, Or the Bible, but he sure used both to dazzle the weak-minded. Now he's getting them to send him money. It's ridiculously ironic, since most of his cult adore him for already being rich.  Wow. Gimme one single policy the man put into effect.",gigi_ c,2021-08-11T07:04:43Z

And I say this as a european. If you think the EU handled the corona crisis good or better than the US you are nuts. We now have for like 1-2 months the pfizer doses for everyone. Before it was only available for ill and old people.

Bc folks have been predicting an avian flu pandemic is long over due.  Wake up, it still is.  And avian flu has wild bird resivoirs which makes it way worse than covid.  People should be thanking thier lucky star it was covid killing the old and sick and NOT young and heathly.  This is outdated.  We know the virus was here in fall 2019.   The true outbreak was people returning from Europe bc you know the virus checks your passport before infecting you.  Our strains on the east coast came from Italy not china. How about we admit that when a novel virus appears we stop influx of folks coming from hot spots like italy.  Once in major east coast cities we allowed folks to flee to other communities like Connecticut spreading it even faster.",Beddy TheCorgi,2021-09-08T13:44:49Z

High social tensions and populists agendas being pushed by all sides of the political spectrum leading to mass protests. 
Campaign of mistrust against state authority making it impossible for the police to enforce/ monitor lockdown measures in hotspot areas with high population density and social weakness playing into the before mentioned issues.

A journalist who concludes, rather than telling both sides and letting the viewer conclude. And unchallenged data as though it were gospel. A simple inquiry would dispel that. Every year for decades the US had 50,000 influenza deaths on a good year, over 100K on a bad one. Look at CDC statistics for influenza in 2020. Influenza deaths evaporated, as if by magic. CDC data is an inconsistent mess, unreliable and not a good starting point for a story.

Which leads to the incompetence that the person you interviewed was speaking about. Government funded institutions like schools are giving incentives to spend their entire budget, regardless of need to ensure getting at least that much money next year, if not more. The waste that occurs as a result is frightening. And all of our systems are flawed in the same way. It‚Äôs embarrassing how low we can go.

I never tire of pointing out the problem of the Covid19 response by the New York Housing Authority. I have a dear friend who lives in the project that was hardest hit by the early pandemic according to Gothamist. Employees and contractors ride elevators and walk the hallways and lobbies without masks.  There never was even till today any NYCHA push for residents wearing masks.  Typically one of two elevators is out of order leading to crowds in the lobby and one working elevator and often there are maskless people present. Call the NYCHA repair  hotline and see there's a recorded message that makes no mention of facemasks. 718 707 7771,Sanctions Kill Kids,2021-04-16T12:30:40Z

"Just pointing this out....as someone who decided to go to a foreign country in Feb. 2020, this is the only report I've seen with a decent timeline as to when people in America became AWARE of Covid.  There were news reports in Dec. of 2019 about Covid in Wuhan and possible issues of it coming to the U.S. due to the Lunar New Year celebrated in China.  I went to South Korea in Feb. and they had about 2,000 cases.  The U.S. was in the single digits, but those people were in critical conditions in hospitals.  I think it was Chicago and Washington State.  I know because we left from Washington.  Had to take a bus from Idaho to Seattle, Washington...then a flight straight to South Korea...so we wouldn't have to go through China or Japan, because I knew, according to the news at that time, that Covid growth was fast and doctors were worried.  Things got crazy in the U.S. from that point on.  Everyone was even arguing about when the news first reported everything.  I was aware, so the news was out in Dec., when I bought my tickets.  That was the reason I got the more expensive tickets that skipped over China and Japan.  Good job reporting a proper timeline.  The arguments over when everything happened, when everyone was aware, when people died or got sick, is absolutely ridiculous and beyond frustrating for someone who lived through it.",Teacher LCampbell,2021-04-09T06:01:44Z

Deadly Germ Research Is Shut Down at Army Lab Over Safety Concerns  
Problems with disposal of dangerous materials led the government to suspend research at the military‚Äôs leading biodefense center.   

Safety concerns at a prominent military germ lab have led the government to shut down research involving dangerous microbes like the Ebola virus.
‚ÄúResearch is currently on hold,‚Äù the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, in Fort Detrick, Md., said in a statement on Friday. The shutdown is likely to last months, Caree Vander Linden, a spokeswoman, said in an interview.
The statement said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention decided to issue a ‚Äúcease and desist order‚Äù last month to halt the research at Fort Detrick because the center did not have ‚Äúsufficient systems in place to decontaminate wastewater‚Äù from its highest-security labs.   

But there has been no threat to public health, no injuries to employees and no leaks of dangerous material outside the laboratory, Ms. Vander Linden said.  

In the statement, the C.D.C. cited ‚Äúnational security reasons‚Äù as the rationale for not releasing information about its decision.  

The institute is a biodefense center that studies germs and toxins that could be used to threaten the military or public health, and also investigates disease outbreaks. It carries out research projects for government agencies, universities and drug companies, which pay for the work. It has about 900 employees.    .....................

The Truth About COVID-19‚Äôs Origin?  
By Devvy Kidd 
|March 16th, 2020  


By: Devvy
For months the Internet has been absolutely drowning in theories about where this COVID-19 actually originated. ‚ÄúMainstream‚Äù print and boob tube media have paraded their share of ‚Äòexperts‚Äô for months making sure the segments wind back around to President Trump as the culprit. 

Many have emailed me over the months asking me my opinion on where it originated. The outbreak erupted in Wuhan over in Commie China. As far as I can tell from my research it was known to their dictator and government as far back as October.  


My dear cousin sent me an article which sent me to several others I believe should be investigated for elimination purposes. Fort Detrick‚Äôs labs are a scary place ‚Äì the one place where safety must be the HIGHEST priority. Apparently not. Please make note of the dates in the pieces. I want readers to know I read every article and column I link. Have to and while I know it‚Äôs a lot of reading, I sure hope you can take time to read them as well.
Going back to August 2, 2019: Fort Detrick lab shut down after failed safety inspection; all research halted indefinitely

FORT DETRICK LAB SHUT DOWN :  

FORT DETRICK LAB SHUT DOWN AFTER FAILED SAFETY INSPECTION; ALL RESEARCH HALTED INDEFINITELY  


Aug 2, 2019 Updated Aug 3, 2019   

All research at a Fort Detrick laboratory that handles high-level disease-causing material, such as Ebola, is on hold indefinitely after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found the organization failed to meet biosafety standards.
No infectious pathogens, or disease-causing material, have been found outside authorized areas at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases.
The CDC inspected the military research institute in June and inspectors found several areas of concern in standard operating procedures, which are in place to protect workers in biosafety level 3 and 4 laboratories, spokeswoman Caree Vander Linden confirmed in an email Friday.

The CDC sent a cease and desist order in July.
After USAMRIID received the order from the CDC, its registration with the Federal Select Agent Program, which oversees disease-causing material use and possession, was suspended. That suspension effectively halted all biological select agents and toxin research at USAMRIID, Vander Linden said in her email.
The Federal Select Agent Program does not comment on whether a program such as USAMRIID is registered and cannot comment on action taken to enforce regulations, Kathryn Harben, a spokeswoman for the CDC, wrote in an email.
‚ÄúAs situations warrant, [Federal Select Agent Program] will take whatever appropriate action is necessary to resolve any departures from regulatory compliance in order to help ensure the safety and security of work with select agents and toxins,‚Äù Harben said in the email.
The suspension was due to multiple causes, including failure to follow local procedures and a lack of periodic recertification training for workers in the biocontainment laboratories, according to Vander Linden. The wastewater decontamination system also failed to meet standards set by the Federal Select 
Agent Program, Vander Linden said in a follow-up email.
‚ÄúTo maximize the safety of our employees, there are multiple layers of protective equipment and validated processes,‚Äù she said.        .........................

"Ah yes, another ""everything is Trump's fault"" video. America is one of the unhealthiest countries in the world due to our culture and lifestyle. That alone helps to explain why as many people died as they did when obesity and it's related illnesses are an enormous risk factor and we're one of the fattest countries in the world. But of course that's conveniently left out of most conversations. Regardless of who was president as many people would have died. Regardless of who was president New York would still be leading the way in terms of deaths because of the fact that you have 20 million people living practically on top of each other and it is extremely easy for a virus to sweep through a city like New York with its massive transportation systems, the near impossible task of contact tracing, etc. This idiotic obsession with blaming Trump for people dying from covid is getting so old. you don't need to like Trump to recognize how stupid it is that he is made to be a scapegoat for everything bad that has happened here. I suppose Italy's government should be blamed for why so many of their citizens died while you ignore the fact that they are an aging population with a lot of health problems and many of them smoke.

The 1918 Spanish flu was the first of two pandemics caused by H1N1 influenza A virus; the second was the 2009 swine flu pandemic.[13]"". For me the main problem was the denial of US President D Trump and the second one is that you don,t have public hospitals, doctors, clinics, health centers to the disposal of all your citizens like we do in Europe.",The english trainer,2021-01-14T10:53:14Z

Truth telling, which is a challenge for any society, has taken a steep hit, with no agreement on even the most basic of facts. The US has the highest number of reported deaths in the world, and it is the most powerful and most technologically advanced nation in the world. But the lies are being pulled down.

then these are the people who died in April in the US from Covid, while the president still refused to adress the problem in any serious way, but praised himself all the time:

-Why not compare US with China directly? Even China couldn‚Äôt believe the 1st doctor that warn them about this pandemic but they did take a response to the pandemic after the rise of the case.

-I know for the people who can‚Äôt understand mandarin like me thought that China disclosed themselves about this virus. But numerous early news about this disease have been reported by local news, check weibo. I mean you need China to spoon-fed you? You just can search for the news. I‚Äôm sure that china descendant around the world have a weibo account & follow the news from the beginning. And translator is a job too, you know?

-Wearing a mask in public is a norm in a lot of country. People wear them because they were sick, allergic to the debris or dust etc. I‚Äôm sure that this alone could make a difference to handle the pandemic.

-Seeing China & Vietnam that are communist, we can see they have a better control of the people. They can order the doctor to control the most risk area. They can order people to lock themselves at home. Order people to guard their neighborhood, distribute food etc. Is communism better to save people lives? I know people been complaining that communism restrict people to speak what in their minds, but have you ask the citizens in those country? Are they happy living under communism?

Hindsight is always 20/20.  

China was dealing with a brand new virus that no one at the time knew  
1. transmit via aerosol droplets 
2. has extra long incubation period  of 7-14 days (instead of typical 3-5 days)  
3.  start to transmitting disease even when the patient doesn't have any symptom.     

And it all happened during the time of Chinese New Year in the city which has been a transportation hub for over 1000 years in central China plain, in which it is not atypical to have 100 million people travel through that city within the 2 weeks period during that time (and no, 100 million is not an exaggeration)

Given the circumstances,  it is almost understandable that the WuHan local government was reluctant to do anything to disrupt 100 million people's lives.    You see this kind dynamics play out through out the world, from Milan to New York.  

The differences is that China's central government step in very quickly and essentially overruled any local government's concern,  lock down the city,  coordinated medical resources, and submit the virus DNA to WHO in record time.

"An example of how journalism employs poor methodology.  Numerous omissions and misinterpretations:
1.) First reported case in the U.S. does not mean actual first case in the U.S., especially given the asymptomatic nature of Sars-CoV-2.
2.) Johnny's unstated implication is that across-the-board external AND internal travel bans should have been put in place either as early as late December or as late as mid-January.  As in other countries in the Americas,  Sars-CoV-2 was also imported from Europe.
3.) The difficulty of developing a test and testing is due to the limitations on the CDC's limitations on translating scientific knowledge of this (7th) new coronavirus into a reliable test to use on symptomatic and asymptomatic persons.
4.) Unlike other diseases, the combination of imperceptibility (high proportion of asymptomatic infected persons) and high contagiousness makes detection, containment, and eradication very difficult, and renders previous playbooks less helpful.
5.) The states in American federalism did lockdown to varying degrees and time periods and are still lockeddown and shutdown to varying degrees, but doing can't be done to extent done in their often smaller, mostly unitary Asian and European counterparts.
6.) Early on Covid-19 medical treatment was on a learning curve, for example, many patients were put on ventilators when they shouldn't have and died, but treatment and therapeutics have improved much.
7.) The medical and health advice communicated early on is still the medical advice communicated today.
8.) Like very cold winters, very hot summers push people indoors with other people, increasing contagion.
9.) Polonged shutdowns and lockdowns have negative health/medical consequences, as well as economic effects, which in turn have negative medical/health consequences.
10.) No mention of demographic and medical pre-condition commorbidities  that increase the likelihood of Covid-19 related death.
11.) Finally, no mention of expanding hospitalization capacities in every state that were not overwhelmed as predicted, no mention of improvements in therapeutics and treatments, no mention of timely expansions of medical supplies, no mention of health insurance coverage adjustments, no mention on impending vaccines.
But there were at least 45 distinct audio, visual, or name references made to President Trump, giving the mistaken impression that the United States is not only a unitary nation but a totalitarian nation completely controlled by one person.

"Hi yeah. Did you read your study?

""The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of cloth masks compared with medical masks in HCWs working in high-risk hospital wards"" 
So it focuses on health care workers in hospitals in 3rd world countries without proper access to protective gear?

Not regular people around the street.

Also it even says that they can't force people not to wear any mask even though it would make for a fairer test because it's unethical for people to work during a pandemic without protection. Showing that any mask is better than no mask.
""Standard practice was used as control because the IRB deemed it unethical to ask participants to not wear a mask""

""It is also unknown whether the rates of infection observed in the cloth mask arm are the same or higher than in HCWs who do not wear a mask, as almost all participants in the control arm used a mask. "" -- so no valid results?

Meanwhile, this study which looked at the population as a whole during Covid and if from the same NIH yours was from shows masks are effective when used properly by the majority.
""In this study, we have shown that face mask use in the general population can have a beneficial impact in reducing the total number of cases and deaths, and that this impact naturally increases with mask effectiveness""

Actually the cdc released another study also posted on NIH that poses the extended risks.

"This is sad. When the citizens in #HongKong , #Taiwan, #Korea, #Japan, #Macau  heard about the virus from the news outbreak coming from CHINA  in end of JAN 2020, I would say 95 % of the people in Hong Kong , Taiwan, Korea, Japan, Macau already start wearing masks starting early FEB 2020, nearly everyone walking on the street or in the building wearing masks. In early FEB, around 70 % of the companies were telling us to start work at home so we can social distance.  The government will hold meeting every day and every week  and go on to press to give press report, to give us update on how many people were having covid and how we should prevent it. How to wear mask and how to find masks.  That was in early FEB 2020 . So we are all quite surprised that #America does not take the virus seriously only until APRIL and MAY ? Not only the government but also the media and the citizen in America, are the citizens not taking it seriously as well ?  We also see news that lots of Americans went out partying, Asians like us ( HK, TW, KOREA, JAPAN) .... WE ARE SHOCKED....American youngsters  partying during covid time ? WHY ? This is selfish .  This is quite sad because we always thought Americans would know better ..... it's really quite sad to hear that Americans so many passed away 200K  people were dead. Is it that people don't have common sense about how serious virus could be? Is it that Americans don't think virus will hit them during JAN and FEB?  Do people think they are iron man and won't get hit by virus? I studied grad school in America 10 years ago and I learnt so much when I was there, but I could never believe this could happen to America now , all the smart people that I know in America, how could this happen when virus hit and people were  naive about virus and  how to prevent it ........ this is careless ... very careless.. quite disappointing ....",Anna Santa,2020-10-28T04:27:52Z

"Because of flu season and the fact that viruses survive longer on cold surfaces, I forsee at least 600k deaths by January 22nd 2021 if America doesn't go into total lockdown. November, December, and January will each average 100k deaths, which is double that of the April spike of 50k deaths. Lingering community infection combined with such a massive part of the population refusing to wear masks or social distance, as well as the Christmas shopping season, could even double that. I wouldn't be surprised to see 200k+ deaths in December. Meanwhile, the economy is at the point of a total freefall collapse into a third world economy for the next two decades, and America is so polarized to the extreme that civil war is pretty much assured regardless of which candidate wins.

I really don't think the country is going to survive this unless everyone learns to overcome their differences to fix things. I have serious doubts that Americans are capable of doing that at this time, so Goodbye America. You've been a great country for 244 years.",RoboJules,2020-10-24T18:52:58Z

But the USA lacks of a real centralized health system, not to say that epidemiological surveillance is gone after the wild orange hog took office. Yet, there are world class institutions here, they are surrounded by poorly educated selfish people whose idea of freedom is their ability to spread disease at their will.  Yes Bush had a handbook to face outbreaks but let's sit down and humble the usanian mind, Europe and some countries in Asia are better than the USA because they enforce sanitary measurements and can produce health products in their territories.  So yes, the CDC is here but nobody listen to it, on top of that private interests outweigh the public safety so COVID for everybody as long the economy is rolling. Remember folks, France has the Pasteur institute, Germany the Koch institute and they are not amateur entities, they have been around for centuries, so next time you want to flatter yourself about US institutions remember they are islands in a sea of ignorance and ill-intentions.",Renan Aguilar-Valenzuela,2020-10-24T17:17:29Z
"There are so many factors as to why Covid cases in America keep getting worst each month, but the main reasons are, as some stated by this video: government response and the culture. Not only did government incompetence failed the people, it was Americans who failed themselves. Face it, we live in a country where it's every man for themselves, we don't think of anyone else, just ourselves. People can choose whether to put on mask, or not. People can choose to stay at home or avoid crowds without masks. You see? This virus just shows how divided America is and the problems with individualism. Also, unlike in other countries, Americans are not used to being told what to do.

"The only thing that will change ANYTHING ist that you go AND VOTE HIM OUT, make an effort, help homeless people to get a ballot and help them with the voting process, go to elderly peoples homes and convince them that if they wish for a better future for their grandchildren, if they don¬¥t want an America equal to Germany between 1933 - 1945, they have to VOTE, go to the high schools and convince those who will vote for their first time, that if they want a ""liveable"" future  - they¬¥ve got to VOTE. MAKE AN EFFORT AS IF YOU¬¥RE LIVES DEPEND ON IT, otherwise his Qanon & Nazi-friends as well as his family of grifters, are going to help 45 into the White House again.
Go out and vote early in troves, if you believe in DEMOCRACY. If 45 already looses on November 3rd, there will be no way forward with their bloody schemes. Neither the current President of the United (in these days Divided) States of America nor the GOP  have any sense of honor, honesty & trustworthiness. They have outlived their days, their termination papers need to be handed out on November 3rd. in a landslide victory for the Democratic party.
These are bitter times for the World and if the US wants to regain their status as leader of that World, they will need a strong government and one that shall not be hindered by a mocking crowd of GOP Senators or Representatives who by now have shown their true colours. If the US does not change the government & the majority within the Senate, the US as a democratic state will finally (after 244 years) fail. I petition EVERY American to check their consience & answer truly: Do I want to live in a Democracy OR do I want to live in a fascistoide Autocracy ? Vote Blue if you prefer Democracy - Vote Red if you prefer an Autocracy.
Just remember: Up to this day of the one term of 45¬¥s administration 215 people of this administration were indicted, 17 of them were convicted ‚Äì during the two terms of President Obama ZERO people were indicted although the Republicans undertook 10 investigations in the Benghazi incident alone. 
The latest executive order signed by Donald Trump will make it easier for him to remove federal workers (such as Dr. Fauci) he doesn't like and fill federal jobs with loyalist. That¬¥s the ‚ÄûArt of politics‚Äú that he¬¥s establishing in the US: LOUDLY bash the enemy with lies, halftruths and threats and silently make sure, that you exchange Professionals with your planted idiots.
The Republican Party used to be a party for all Americans, a party that fought an internal war against slavery (Lincoln) & a party that endorsed immigration to strengthen the country (Reagen/Bush sr.).

"I always find it interesting how it's always just developed countries patting their back about doing good and the completely forget the developing ones. 

Most developing countries were at serious disadvantage when this pandemic began. Densely populated areas in cities, many people below poverty line, lack of hygiene in most places, no strong health infrastructure, way less resources and way more people if we consider countries in Asia like India, phillipines, Thailand etc. 

And yes these countries have grim numbers but I personally believe it's an accomplishment that their numbers match EU and USA. I mean technically they are performing exactly the same way as developed nations with much less resources and way more odds against them. If they actually had the resources they would have easily controlled it by now.

"@DoYouThinkForUrselF it is known to be spread in part through aerosol, fomites, and droplets. Fomites can be best described as any object upon which viruses are Laden. For instance, if you wipe your nose and touch your clothes, your clothes would be a fomite in this setting. Aerosols and droplets are really the same thing but the key distinction is size. Virus is present in open-air leave the body when they are attached to some object or cluster of water molecules in the form of aerosol or droplets. What you have to remember is that at the molecular and viral scale, air behaves far more like a gel or semi-solid material. Water and solid particles at the sizes that allow for viruses to spread through the air don't really face the same kind of restrictions to gravity due to their small size. Instead, other forces play a much bigger role. A good example of this can be seen when you look at something like the fairy fly, the smallest insect. It doesn't have wings in the traditional sense and can be more accurately described as swimming through air rather than flying.  Google it if you're interested.  This video can give you a pretty good primer to get you in the right mind space (https://youtu.be/f7KSfjv4Oq0). They're really out there. That said, these insects are relatively large by the standard we were talking about at between 1/2 millimeter and 1 mm.  For reference, the current debate over how to divide droplets which are larger and aerosols which are smaller range is between Drawing the Line somewhere at 5 micrometers to 20 micrometers. An aerosol would be the smaller of the two. One micrometer is a thousand times smaller than 1 mm. All this is kind of getting in the Reeds but it gives you an idea about the environment that droplets and aerosol are present in.  As a result, they don't really fall in the same sense of the word that we are used to. When you breathe out particles of droplets and aerosol, they linger in the air. The viruses in comparatively larger droplets fall faster to the ground and thus do not have as large of a range as they would have they been attached to aerosol particles. It's not that they are more affected by gravity but as I mentioned, they are much more subject to other forces at that size. Water naturally evaporates when in liquid form and droplets and aerosols are no different. Virus is present on water particles sufficiently small as to evaporate faster than the effects of gravity would cause them to fall into their size have a further spread because I mentioned, air behaves a lot more like a gel at that scale.  This is why they talked about aerosol spread being so much more dangerous. Source: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7293495/

A cloth face mask catches these water molecules preventing a great deal of virus particles being spread.  When your breath must pass through multiple layers of tightly woven fabric, it doesn't really stop small viruses but it does stop a lot of the particles in which they are present. Viruses rely on riding on those particles. Does it stop all of them, no. Does it stop free-floating viruses? Perhaps but not really given their size. Is stopping some spread better than taking no steps to mitigate spread?  Of course.

Single layer cloth masks are not really that effective but multiple layers greatly increase the chances that these particles will be caught up and the virus along with them. Here is a study looking at the effectiveness of single layer cloth mask vs hybrid cloth masks for blocking particles greater than and smaller than 300 nanometers. For reference, there are 1000 nanometers in a micrometer (source :https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsnano.0c03252)

Also, it should be stated that all might spread will be reduced by having your mouth and nose covered. You can't cough or sneeze into your hands and promote fomites spread when you have a mask on",Jason Wilkins,2021-03-28T15:42:49Z
"@Jason WilkinsThere is a reason gov't or news never tell you ""lowers transmission rates by.....""

      Thank you. Your study or page was not available.    The first one was however and i skimmed it looking for a study that gave numbers of infection with and with out mask.   Maybe i missed it but i did find this in your first  link.      
         "" , but surgical masks are believed to be not preventing aerosol transmission, and N95 respirators are recognized to be preventing aerosol and droplet transmission""    

    Notice how it says BELIEVED......they don't even give any numbers, that is what is so frustrating about this subject. 

       Now a N95 mask with a respirator has a filter which is much different then a surgical mask.  Surgical masks  i have seen doctors say are used for prevention of bacteria going into a patient during surgery, bacteria are much larger then virus's.  

       If you have a filter that is a much different thing, it only lasts so long and you have to change it out.   It is however much more effective of course.   It's why scientists / medical personal studying Ebola and other deadly pathogens wear full body suits with respirators.  

      You can talk all day long about how masks MAY prevent infection but studies show unless you are wearing expensive PPE that you have to change out filters on,   you are not actually preventing anything and that bears out in a 1% difference in (transmission rates) studies and real world data of masked counties vs non masked counties (CDC 1.32%)  

       The studies show this, the real world shows this, yet when numbers are introduced it devolves into a opinion debate and ALL numbers are left out.   Just like your article there was nothing showing infection rates are lowered by our mandatory policies in place now.   Data / evidence on transmission rates are left out.  

     So in short you have have an OPINION but don't tell people it's based on evidence that shows these policies are lowering transmission rates.   That just makes you a  political pundit or worse.",DoYouThinkForUrselF,2021-03-28T16:49:36Z

"Oblivious?  Think it was worse, a calculated decision as he knows his base, and his very hold on power rely on 'magical thinking', questioning everything, as we all should, yet disregarding all standards and methods for arriving at the truth, just fantasy logic.

He knew this legion of rebels without a clue were anxiously waiting for the coming of their messiah and easily stepped in, he always had one foot in, just keep it up, be vague, drop them some easter eggs, never answer questions or defend, always attack, throw support behind every quack theory that sows confusion as there are millions of morons that think the ideas are being suppressed for some nefarious reason, as opposed to never given serious thought because the great pumpkin just doesn't exist, but he knew they would love him for it as they already did. He does the same thing as the history channel, some believe, I heard it, not saying it's true, but it deserves to be heard.

"Obviously our public health authorities bungled the job.  The government should have immediately seized some paper factories and set them to work making N-95 masks for free distribution.  Trump didn't even consider such a step until meat packing plants were going to close because the workers were getting sick and didn't want to work there anymore then it was a threat to keep the factories going, not to address the pandemic or safety issues.   Instead, fearing for low mask supplies,  the public were lied to and told that masks weren't effective and not to wear one unless you were a medical professional.  We still don't have anyone making masks in bulk.  Lockdowns don't work because they go against human nature, and they ignore that the US is a service economy where most people live paycheck to paycheck.  The folly of assuming everyone is upper middle class was plentifully proved by Hurricane Katrina, but did our government agencies learn from that? They did not.  Even today there is a lack of intelligence in our planning and our public health people are morons.  People don't trust our scientists because they have bungled obvious things over and over: masks are the key to controlling the virus and they should be mass produced, distributed free, and there should be criminal penalties for those who refuse to wear them.  The same idiots who told us nuclear power is safe even though no nuclear facility has been built to last longer than 200 years and every day they produce waste which is highly lethal for tens of thousands of years are the kind of risk illiterates who thought a few weeks off work would do the job on covid19",George Hooper,2020-10-18T22:51:46Z

Here‚Äôs the short answer:  Trump,LorraElizabeth,2020-10-17T16:16:09Z
"You fail to mention that when President Trump announced a restriction on foreigners traveling from mainland China from Feb. 2, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) who was on the ground in China monitoring the situation, along with China and the Democrats criticized Trump and Pelosi encouraged people to go to Chinatown.  There was a lack of information from the World Health Organization in the early days on measures that are appropriate for this pandemic.  The WHO was more alarmist about the Swine flu pandemic than they were about covid in the early stages and since the swine flu petered out and was never as big as predicted, you cannot blame people for not being alarmist.  If the WHO was on the ground in China and they knew this virus was lethal, why were they criticizing the USA, Australia and New Zealand for banning flights from China.  No nation apart from South Korea and Taiwan were adequately prepared for this pandemic, they had learnt from their previous pandemic and already had systems in place and adequate masks and PPE to effectively deal with the pandemic.  Dr Fauci and the World Health Organization discouraged people from wearing masks, as there were not enough masks for medical personnel.  The issue was that masks came from China and they were not exporting, in fact Chinese business people were buying up PPE equipment in the West, including masks and sending them to China and Hong Kong.  Masks disappeared off the shelves in the first few weeks once it became apparent that the virus was spreading rapidly across the globe.  The advice given to the public about not buying and wearing masks was then adopted by all governments in Western Nations and only after the second wave were people encouraged to either buy or make their own masks, at which time masks were made available, since China had started manufacturing and exporting them again and some nations started making their own masks.  Sadly aged care facilities were not equipped with PPE and infected aged were discharged from hospital and returned to aged care facilities, where they infected other residents, resulting in increased number of deaths, particularly in NY.  So the USA and majority of nations were not well prepared for the pandemic.  It is not enough to have a guidebook, there needs to be sufficient PPE and every hospital should have protocols and regular training for all medical personnel on the protocol and on how to use PPE correctly.  Contact tracing also needs to be improved and quarantine of infected people needs to be properly managed.  This pandemic has been a costly lesson and not all states in the USA did poorly in managing the virus spread.  This is evident in the much lower number of deaths.  Yes Trump did not take it seriously initially, but neither did the WHO and don't forget that Trump was acting on health advice.  He may not always communicate well, but once he was made aware of the seriousness of the virus, he did act very quickly in providing ventilators, PPE and funding vaccine research.  If we are going to point the finger, then we also need to look at how individual states handled the crisis and why some did better than others.  It's the same in Australia, all the states handled it well, except for the Victorian government, who mishandled the hotel quarantine, which accounted for 95% of covid cases.",Purple queen,2020-10-17T13:44:34Z

I would have learned as much as possible from other the other leaders who'd been dealing with virus prior, heeded the CDC and WHO and addressed the American people with our plans asap. Then I would have enacted Federal orders for masks, social distancing and sanitization. Initially I would have partially closed the country (reduced people in restaurants and such) and mandated that if a business is capable, they are to move to a remote model; this would be for 14-30 days. After assessing the results, a partial shutdown might be continued for an additional 30-90 days, or we may go into a full shutdown for 14-30 days. Virus testing would have been shared between the government and private parties to get as much testing as possible done in short(er) amount of time. I would have addressed the population at least once a week to note our progress and to encourage people not only to be careful, but also practice good hygiene and nutritional and physical fitness. I also would have protected the elderly as much as I were able.",JH,2020-10-21T04:33:59Z

Also the epicenter of pandemic in US, New York got infected from Italy not China because the borders were closed already with China while Italy was open.

"Hells Bell and buckets of blood, at first it was to flatten the curve, then close and board up everything, including schools, then wear masks constantly,then keep schools closed before any reopened. Keep college and universities shut. A vaccine may be a year or two down the pike, if ever. Retroviruses are vaccine dodgers. Look at A I D S 40 years later! It may never arrive.  A vaccine will be forced upon everybody when the time comes. Out of nearly 8 billion people in the world, the death rate of Sars-cov2 appears to be .002% in ages under fifty. For kids, studies 
indicate they have a higher chance of being struck by lightning, We are treating covid-19, as if no one ever survives, like rabies, anthrax, Ebola or amoebic meningitis, when the exact opposite is true. The needs of the few do not outweigh the needs of the many. Even hypochondriacs and germ0phobes have immune systems. Many diseases of the 20th century have invaded our golden shores. 
Like when boats from China carrying infected rats brought Bubonic plague to the West coast in the 1920s. Now endemic in the rodent populations 
from Oregon to New Mexico. Dengue fever was last seen in Florida in 2020. We've had our share of incurable diseases. TB, smallpox, tetanus, typhoid fever, scarlet fever, 
typhus, gangrene, yellow fever and Polio. which was without a treatment or cure for decades. Yet the world never shut down and schools remained open. Rabies remains 100% fatal without treatment. But has faded into the background because we vaccinate our pets and stay vigilant. It is no longer the death sentence it once was.Quite a few young folk seem to be content with giving up a lot of freedom for a tiny bit of security. But life is a risk, safety is never guaranteed. From shop clerks, hairdressers, dentists, optometrists and teachers' unions. They seem infected with fear and its spreading. Mainstream media is more than happy to give a voice to the insanity. I call it the corona-crazies. As of yet, there's no cure.Symptoms include forced staring at maskless faces, panic buying of toilet paper and hand sanitizer, aversion to rational thought and a total loss of all perspective.

From statues, monuments, pancake mix, maple syrup,team names and our National anthem, the Star spangled banner, written in 1814. I'm sure the List will grow as time passes. Don't be fooled,they have a much larger hidden agenda. Their secret wish is to dismantle the Bill of Rights part of our U.S. Constitution, as we know and love it.

"Honestly, in my opinion, the US never stood a chance because even if Trump would've said ""we're closing everything down to save american lives bla bla bla..."", and followed the protocols himself, the sheer amount of stupidity, incompetence and so called ""freedom"" in the country would've made it impossible to shut it down. 

Lets face it: the anti-maskers, the ""corona is a hoax"", the ""it's a free country, you can't force me to stay inside"", ""I want to go to church"" people would still be present in very high numbers and even if you tried to force the lockdown on those people, with say...using the army on the streets and stuff, then more idiots would start to gather on the streets to protests.

Not to mention that there are a lot of people in power (and rich) who would also find different ways to gather and just generally do what they want.

"Several things: 1 the people most likely to die already did, 2 we now have better treatment because we know more, 3 maybe a lot of those cases come from people who got only a small load of virus. Severity of illness is linked to the infectious dose. So, if people now catch a small dose because the masks help or if they social distance but not quite enough they might create a lot of non severe cases. Which is still not good but would explain how you can have lots of cases but not lots of deaths. 4 hospitals should be better prepared now and have eg reserved / installed more beds per capita of population they serve, 5 we now test a lot more. Probably there were many more unconfirmed cases in March. 6 the virus might already have mutated to be more contagious but less deadly (which happens with most viruses over time, I'm just not sure if it can happen that fast. OTOH, this is a Corona virus and they mutate rather fast, so I'd guess it's possible).",TheFeldhamster,2020-10-16T10:24:54Z

"If trump closed the US down for 2 weeks and ramped up testing and told people to wear a mask for 1 month, we'd have 10 cases and none of us would have to wear a mask. He failed us. He was a failure as a leader, and he was a failure to fix the pandemic. Instead he had to spend 6 trillion to bail out wall street because he was such a failure to contain the virus. Then he had to bail out the people he failed to 2 trillion and who are largely about to go homeless in great depression level numbers without further relief. So 10 trillion because he couldn't deal with 10 sick people is unbelivably weak. 
People who are worried won't go out and buy stuff to fix the economy until they are not scared. Trump would rather lie then admit he screwed up. That's why he's pushing a vaccine so he can just ""make the problem go away"". He thinks that if a vaccine exists (even if no one has it) that fear will disappear and things will go back to normal, he can take credit for the 'win' and the economy will rebound. But he's specfically done everything but actually fix the pandemic. He's incapable of fixing anything and taking responsibility.

"Lmao this documentary sucked! It was all just more misinformation and lies! Trump did all he could to prevent Americans from dying during this pandemic from China and i would say he has been largely successful! From his travel ban in January a to his use of the defense production act he was on top of this outbreak from the beginning! The main reason for alot of these 215,000 deaths in this country is the fact that the governor of New York and other democrat state governors forced sick covid19 patients into nursing homes and seinior care centers and assisted living homes for the elderly who should have been isolated from covid19 patients! They caused tens of thousands of those deaths! Not Trumps fault! The other main reason we have 215,000 reported deaths from covid19 is they are reporting deaths WITH covid and deaths FROM covid as the same thing! People how die in car crashes get tested in the morgue an it comes back positive for covid they are getting counted in that 215,000 when they had no symptoms and probably didn't even know they had it before they die. So in America we are lying about our covid19 death, saying that they are higher than they really are and at the same time other countries are lying about their covid19 death numbers saying that they are lower than they really are!

"THE REST OF THE STORY...Trump created a Covid Taskforce made up of Experts who employed social distancing, hand washing & mask wearing.  Trump worked with the governors of every state because federal mandates are unconstitutional & the USA had a 45 day nationwide shut down of all non-essential workers in order to ""flatten the curve"". Projections were that we would lose over 2 million.  We shut down travel from China in Jan before any death had occurred & prior to any other nation & against the recommendation of Fauci,  FDA &  CDC.  Why were the experts all against shutting down travel from China?  Why was Biden against it?   Then we shut down travel from Europe. Fauci told us early on that masks didn't work & in fact could spread the virus from improper use & people touching the masks.  Later he admitted that he wanted to save PPE for the hospital workers.  China had bought up all available masks & the US was no longer producing enough PPE for the demand.   Testing was screwed up by the CDC, 1st they wanted their own ""better' testing, then they wouldn't relinquish control & finally when they allowed private business to produce tests, the CDC gave faulty info  & we wasted time & materials & had to start over.  Why was the CDC dragging it's feet on mass producing tests?   Dr. Birks told us that all death for any reason are counted as Covid deaths, even if the patient was asymptomatic & died in a car crash as long as they tested positive.   Why did NYC force Elderly Covid patients back into nursing homes when the Javits center & the medical ship were empty?  Why was HCQ vilified when it was the primary treatment in Europe?  The studies  stating HCQ was ineffective & dangerous have since been debunked & yet that is not covered as widely in the news as the smear campaign against an effective protocol.  The protocol included HCQ, zinc & z-pak, yet the studied either didn't include all 3 or disqualified successful studies because it didn't isolate HCQ (which doesn't work in isolation), it works as a transport for zinc into the cell & z-pak deals with the inflammation.  Sweden didn't lock down has roughly the same mortality rate as other nations who did lock down, so the lockdowns didn't work, they ended up slowing the spread but not stopping it. Now Sweden has one of the only economies that wasn't damaged by the Covid lockdowns.

"I generally agree with what's presented in the video, and it's great that Johnny looked into it. However, I want to point out that the idea that a few weeks of lockdown stops the virus and solves the problem (16:37 in the video) is a big exaggeration. I know this because in my country (Ukraine) it did not work. We had at least two months of a very strict lockdown in March and April, and May was also quite serious. And then more and more limitations were removed. As a result, in spring we had a very light pandemic situation, and the healthcare system made a lot of preparations during this time to ensure it can handle more patients. But now it's autumn and Ukraine is #8 in the world by the number of active COVID-19 cases with record-high numbers of deaths, hospitalizations, and new cases for our country (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/ukraine/). So a few weeks of strict lockdown are good, but far from enough.

"A lot changes in only a couple weeks. Unfortunately, Covid is now spreading rapidly in the EU (I'm pulling data from Johns Hopkins site 10/10/2020, same site presenter used). 

The current 7 day average for the EU is now 126.8 per million (maybe 50% higher than what they where when the graph was made), about where the US was at the end of that graph.  

Be interesting to see what happens this week, as many of those countries are experiencing very rapid growth, many for the last month or so. France had 14% of their total cases just this week (the total this week divided by their total recorded since the records began). Netherlands about 20%, Czechia 28%, Belgium and Poland 16 to 17%.  As a whole, the EU has seen 11.5% of their cases this week. Which means it's growing rapidly.

Covid is probably under control in some places, but neither the EU nor the US can claim we have it under control.",Ron Bremner,2020-10-10T18:02:51Z

"@Lu Lu First, we're pretty much guaranteed that any statistics are wrong. They are always based on the data at hand, not the exact, correct data. But Johnny Harris believes that there is an inherent difference between the US results and the EU results. The last couple of weeks, those are beginning to converge very fast. I am simply pointing out that if he had today's data, his graphs would have looked different.

He's an excellent presenter, but his conclusion lacks proof. The reasons for the differences may be that we do more testing, that some people in the EU can't or don't make it to testing etc. My point is simply that the situation is changing dramatically, per the statistics we're given.  The US is also increasing. But why are we increasing now, after a dip? And why is the EU now increasing at an incredible rate? I can guess (which is what Johnny does). But my guesses don't change the results. Johnny believes it is because Trump didn't follow the guidelines he had. My guess is that we've become Covid weary, we've seen drops in numbers for a while, and so became less cautious, that the startup of colleges has resulted in increased testing, and a jump in the numbers of young people having Covid. 

The last seems to be supported by the data. College age youth are being tested positive in large numbers right now. I don't know if the same is true in the EU. But as many have said, this should not have been politicized. This is a health issue, and both sides are at fault for making it political. That's another reason for the Covid tiredness. My party says xyz. And for both parties, that's not science.",Ron Bremner,2020-10-11T14:51:01Z

"US is best prepared for a pandemic? Materialistically, US had to hijack PPE shipments and ran out of places to even bury bodies in New York alone (mass grave in hart island etc) 2 months into the pandemic. 

Materialistic preparedness also matters very little. After H1N1, SARS, and other corona viruses, those countries that suffered a lot like China and Asian pacific countries knew instinctively it is not something to be taken lightly. Once the news got out, people started wearing masks without a mandate and isolated themselves. US's 'preparedness' is screaming giving me freedom or give me death at the top of their lungs in big gatherings. US's 'preparedness' is the president attacking CDC doctors and the right starting conspiracy theories. US's 'preparedness' is criticsing other countries, other organisation, or even the Lancet that had a COVID-19 warning as early as January 24th,  just to ensure that at least one scapegoat sticks.

Over 60 the rate shoots up between 1 in 200 will die.  Age and health being factors that could make it 1 in 50.

And here we usually don't have people having their lives ruined by some emergency or getting cancer and end up dying or surviving just to work to return their medical debt.

"sorry but that's just not true as to how they should be calculated! Consider it yes, but large population doesn't mean deaths will automatically be larger. The only population number that can matter is the population in the immediately hit region when the virus first enters the country, from that point it's possible to close the area off to prevent the rest of the population being exposed, as can be seen in Wuhan, Hawaii & Melbourne (Hawaii to stop entry, the other 2 to contain it within). Nothing stopping states from closing state borders in the same way countries do, so as to protect their population from the virus!",Lilac Lizard,2020-10-10T10:09:38Z
"‚Äã@UChLJZvy50edvmaupDaK8T3Q There's other far more significant issues in comparing Europe to the US, such as it has land borders stretching the whole way to China & the virus hit there way before any real warnings were available. If you want an accurate comparison of countries to the US/all of the continent of North America, compare it to Australia & sure, times the numbers in Australia by 13 if you want to for balance, but entry numbers, city size size & density is already on par between Australia & America & plenty of serious screw ups in Australia to do away with an expectation the US won't have them too, such as releasing a highly infected cruise ship of 3300 people into the middle of a city of 5 million people & flying infected people from that ship to every state & territory before realising there was an infection there, due to communication breakdowns.

South Korea did well on PR, but in reality that was all! The virus there was confined to a religious cult, so it was easy to track all cases, as they kept insisting on attending their cult meetings for easy tracing. Later the virus in Korea exited that cult & entered a Rainbow person bar, at which point all their contact tracing completely failed & they locked down! The same cult then organised political protests & caused mass infections again too. Korea currently has poor control compared to a lot of other countries. Tech has in fact consistently failed in every country where it's been attempted. It's had some huge successes, but overall it's no-where near good enough for enough tracing to control the virus. Good humans, good systems & attitudes that lead to good co-operation from those infected is what has successfully worked. 

Compare the results in NSW Australia with South Korea, Japan, Hong Kong & any others that have had new outbreaks starting in July. NSW/Sydney & Hong Kong got a single case within 3 days of each other (2nd & 5th July) Korea got a new outbreak same time too, but not as clear as to starting numbers/cause, total cases in Sydney have been only around 800, while all the other have had that many cases each day at the peak. Sydney picked up 300 contacts through an app, but mostly it's just used people calling infected people to ask them where they've been, along with legislation to require all venues collect contact details on all visitors & upload them to the health department's site every 24 hours & pop up clinics are set up in the carparks/front yard of any venue that gets a positive case to pick up any people who missed the news about it when they try to return to the now closed venue. Good old fashioned phone calls & human tracing has won out! Sydney has 300 people in bars, clubs etc throughout, tens of thousands allowed at outdoor venues, while South Korea has closed them all down. Hong Kong's limited to 5 people gatherings on top of closing venues.

I don't question that trump screwed up badly, but so did a lot of others in the US! The governors should have closed state borders & taken over the management of the pandemic when trump failed to! The National shut down was initiated by one state leader in Australia (with a second one supporting it). She decided she was doing it & so announced it a few hours before the meeting with the PM to decide what measures were going to be put in place. PM could either do it Nationally & take the credit for it, or fight with her & find out how much power the states held the hard way, so they all worked together & played nice & she let him pretend it was his idea & take the credit & leadership for the National lockdown. No reason the US couldn't have done the same, like I said Hawaii did!",Lilac Lizard,2020-10-10T13:35:14Z
"If you want to see what would have happened if America had done everything in those plans & discussed in this video, then simply look at Australia, cause it followed the playbook & discussions in this video. It had some major screw ups, but it just picked back up after them & dealt with them. 

Virus eliminated in January, reintroduced from America in March, lightly locked down for 6 weeks immediately & near eliminated it, re-opened slowly while continuing elimination, 
re-introduced through a major mistake in June, but having all but one state border closed for infection control due to an earlier screw up's lessons learnt, all but the 2 states with open borders remained clear of the virus & fully operational, 
locked down again one state, due to people being unco-operative with rules, other state had co-operative people, so remained near fully open while eliminating, still working on it, with 13 cases in the last month in NSW, averaging 9 cases a day in Victoria/Melbourne due to lockdown enforcing control, whether people are willing to help or not.

Australia & America started out in exactly the same place, both being island continents separated from the virus, but with extensive visitors to the countries. 1 country did everything suggested in this video, the other ignored everything suggested in this video, hence why one has under 1000 deaths total, while the other is at 1000 deaths a day & going into winter with no control - which is NOT a good place to be!!!!!!

Cant fight a pandemic without nationalizing which is actually even more important than clear communication because at least if everyone is coordinating and sharing resources and information, even if you are not communicating, you are still going to be more effective than if you are communicatin perfectly but you don't nationalize,. Ill be back to talk about this.",Juna Nougues,2020-10-09T13:35:31Z
"The Ninja Virus: Asymptomatic Driver. 

Reviewing the pandemic timeline without talking about the asymptomatic component is like talking about cars without tires. Fauci mentions in the January Journal of New England Med.  that the virus was probably not driven by people without symptoms. Based on what? NOTHING. So that's one clear instance early on when we see Fauci already going along with the administration's playbook to play down the virus.  Because in public health we never erase anything from the white board, especially worst case scenarios, without empirical evidence. And the other thing is that there was already circumstantial evidence that the virus was indeed spreading asymptomatically. Hows that? China, along with South Korea has one of the best epidemiology response programs in the world. They take this scenario seriously because of their past frightening experiences and their response and deployment teams are second to none. So what happened? Why did China initially fumble the ball so badly? Easy, because the were fighting the last war, SARS. And SARS had a higher lethality rate than COVID and its cases were all symptomatic which means it was easier to detect and thus control. So China went and did its thing. But after three weeks the numbers weren't adding up and thats when they started backtracking because they figured out they had many more cases.  Sympotomless carriers passing the virus to unhealthy people who were far more at risk of dying. So basically a virus that 'figured out' how to spread by using healthy people to launch onto new hosts of more vulnerable carriers, including a nightmare scenario of a goldilocks ratio of R to lethality.  So that the virus was killing a lot of people and just enough to be very destructive 10x the power of the flu, but not enough to be able to get detected early. Now, that's a HUGE part of this story and Harris, again, doesn't even touch on it AT ALL!!  Why ????  A New York times journalist that misses this key part of the story might as well be reporting for the New York Post. Unacceptable. And, worse, our nation's top infectious disease expert discounting this scenario is worse than incompetent; its medical malpractice. Because he is putting his career ahead of the public interest and health. Because he is potentially exposing to harm literally tens of thousands of lives with an assumption like that. And, yet, nobody talks about this, WHY?  And then we see South Korea. The same thing happens to South Korea because China was not going to tell the world why it fumbled the ball because its cultural, like loosing face. So South Korea initially fumbled it that way too until it figured it had to backtrack, too. And they also failed to telll anyone, 'look out, this virus is 40 to even 60% driven by people without any symptoms. (Has to do with the incubation phase)",Juna Nougues,2020-10-09T13:24:30Z

"Numbers that Matter. 

The R(0) which is the infectivity estimate, and lethality, F is what we want to pay attention. Oddly these are not totally independent. For example, imagine a virus that is so lethal that a human cannot transmit because they die too fast. So if a virus is not very lethal its transmission rate is also going to go up because there are simply far more undetected cases that make it far more difficult to control. 

March 17th R(0) US National rate for the coronavirus is 2+, and F= ~3.5%. The current statistics suggest that as of first week of Oct. 2, the Covid-19 infectivity rate, R(0), was 1.06, and a death rate of 3.3%.

Before I begin let's review a few basics from this story that Harris nor his friend astonishingly don't even touch on:  a) the difference between mitigation and suppression strategy.  b) the critical and irreplaceable CAN NOT DO without for fighting a pandemic in any country or era of history: NATIONALIZATION of the response. c) Why everybody fumbled this ball intially: the goldilocks virus with the asymptomatic lethal component.  d) why political ideology doomed us from the beginning.,Juna Nougues,2020-10-09T10:23:55Z

J Harris DOES NOT go deep here into anything and in this video at least is just splashing around ankle deep in a baby pool of actual research, understanding and insight.

Like a little kid that covers the ears with both hands and makes loud noises to avoid having to hear and engage with a depressing reality in an objective way.

Cuomo really lashed out at Trump when he suggested doing that with NY to prevent the virus making it to other parts of the US, intimidating him out of making the call (the call that Cuomo should have made himself, the Melbourne leader did in Australia).

"Can't fight a pandemic well over a hundred times differently, that's such a poor strategy and doesn't hide the fact America as a whole failed to meet this challenge and, basically, failed to come together as a nation when it most needed to. Before a very dangerous bug that from the beginning we chose to play down, to this day. And so the virus continues to kick our polarized nation's butt. We are, for whatever reason, incapable of rolling up our sleeves and presenting a unified front before an urgent public health crisis. That's a problem if a nation looses its capacity to nationalize a crisis when it needs to. Big story nobody really wants to talk about. But it's a pretty big and massive elephant most everybody wants to ignore. The failure to even consider nationalizing the strategy and tactics for engaging with a killer virus and  formidable adversary. That's the story here. No other failure  is as important. Not having the capacity to coordinate our efforts on a national level. Nobody wants to even mention it, but is there even another country that chose to  fragment the response like we did? That's not just nuts behavior, but dumb. Playing it down, and then breaking into different state responses?? Huh?",Juna Nougues,2020-10-31T01:56:44Z

"Wow, that's a lot of information to get from one graph. One might think it was probably grossly simplifying factors. Like for instance showing the EU broken down by country, and showing the US as a single mass, when conditions between say New York and Oklahoma were as different as the Italy and Denmark. Blame Trump for not cooperating Xin while China was busy buying up every PPE stock in the world (practically looted Australia), kinda indicates China was never going to be a cooperative partner. Blame Trump for not being focused in January, what could he possibly have been doing in January, oh yeah a farcical impeachment that was propped up til the last day by the New York Times. When Trump did take active and decisive action like the travel ban, he was attacked as xenophobic and racist, not just by Democratic opponents like Biden but by the New York Times. Rave about the pandemic preparedness from previous administrations and then fail to mention that Obama never restocked the US strategic reserve (SNS) after the 2009 Flu epidemic, California defunded it's own reserve under Jerry Brown and New York auctioned off its own state reserve in 2014. Rave about Germany's scientific response, while talking about cell phone tracking, then quote numbers for Italy and Spain because Germany's tracking numbers weren't that much different than the US.

Unquestionably, there were major errors in the Trump administrations response, and Trumps messaging is certainly fair game. But the simple numbers show that 4 states (really 2 or 3 due to their population) are the reason the US's numbers are so much worse than Europe. There are 4 states that have the highest death rate per 100,000 residents: New Jersey (182), New York (171), Massachusetts (138), and Connecticut (127). The last probably should not be on the list due to their small actual population, but its worth pointing out that most of their cases were commuters from NYC. The attempt to blame red and blue states evenly is pretty farcical when the evil red state examples are Texas with 57 deaths per 100,000 and Florida with 69 deaths per 100,000. Also, while looking at the all important graph, they never discuss anything that happened in May that might have affected a massive spike in June. If only there was some massive social gathering of people in direct contradiction of lockdown orders. A series of events or even a ""movement"" that not only coincides with outbreaks in areas that had so far seen little spread and even was allowed to gather in large numbers in localities that had draconian lockdown orders like NYC, Cook County and Los Angeles.

As always with the NY Times, it's a little more complicated than they present it. But people get all weak in the knees because the presentation format is pretty slick. But really, all these posters who are fawning over this Johnny Harris because, look he's got a stack of actual paper on his desk and look at the graph. Get a life. Or better yet stop reading a newspaper that has been actively lying since at least the Spanish American War.

"A bit bias here.  China informed the WHO that they had a virus on December 31, 2019. It was only in the first week of January that China confirmed human-human transmission was possible. China only identified the virus on the 7 January. Genomic data was released by China on the 12 January, allowing the germans to create a PCR test a few days later. Human-human transmission confirmed 21 January.  The PCR test show that >80% of all infected people are asymptomatic, China attempt to use thermometers to screen and detain people with fever are useless. The virus is everywhere, even outside the City of Wuhan. China locks down Hubei province, population 60 million 23 January. 

China did request for aid and every south east asian nation gave what they could. The US gave nothing but wanted to send inspectors. Not doctors, not medical supplies, inspectors. Of the EU nations, only Italy sends aid. Cuba send doctors. 

All the US was interested at the time for the Trade war. Given how the pandemic had effectively torn out the China's industrial heartland,  China is not interest in US inspectors freely running around  probing the effects of the virus.

"capacity to carry out that style of system is dependent on how educated the population is & how willing they are to participate though, so it's not relevant for the US & there's better examples of that in action in other countries, where death tolls are much lower. NSW v Victoria Australia is the perfect example of this, the people in Melbourne Victoria chose to believe conspiracies & as such required heavy duty lockdowns & still had massive fatalities, while in the next door state Sydney saw people acting as they are in Sweden, so no need for lockdowns once overseas backpackers had been removed from the country. Victoria, outside Melbourne was the same, once they fenced off Melbourne to stop them spreading it, there was no difficulty at all containing it in regional areas & restrictions could be removed. Plenty of countries have done better than Sweden with far less rules than Sweden.

300 people in indoor venues at once is the norm in Sydney, 40,000 in an outdoor stadium also not seen as an issue, due to ongoing control of the virus through testing, tracing & isolating contacts. Sweden's sticking at 50 people max for years & none watching sport as opposed to the 40,000 in Sydney & most of Australia",Lilac Lizard,2020-10-10T09:52:16Z
"‚Äã@MrRol52 would be really interesting after this is over to study in detail the health messaging & other factors that might have lead to compliance/rebellion in various countries & states around the world. Melbourne did seem to miss it with non-English speakers, but was the health messaging overall that different to every other state in Australia? I really am curious what caused the defiance in Melbourne & I really dont' think it's been properly answered so far. 1 interesting difference is the tougher rules & fines in Victoria in March, it would be interesting to know if that was a factor in getting the people off side. eg the no intimate partners to your home rule & no driving lessons with parents, while NSW was welcoming not only that, but even driving instructor lessons. Round 2 of lockdowns did try to be nice on that stuff though, allowing fishing, golf surfing etc etc, so I'm not convinced it was that, I really don't know what exactly was the reason. Government incompetence feelings from the public doesn't really explain it after the Ruby Princess & slow Victorian border closure NSW had to deal with",Lilac Lizard,2020-10-10T11:48:40Z
"‚Äã@MrRol52 agreed that was a major failure & the protests contributed to that too, since they sent visual messages to people, who didn't have a good understanding of the virus at that point, that it was ok to be close to others again. Melbourne isn't the only city with that issue though. I mean it is interesting that the areas of Sydney with the most cases right now are also the areas where large numbers of non-English speakers live, but there's not the same level of ignorance (or doesn't seem to be) & initial messaging was coming primarily from the federal government, so all states were getting the same, so I'm just not totally buying that alone as being enough to cause the problems in Melbourne & not equally or at least significantly in other states (Sydney in particular) too.

I know one point that's been raised is that NSW has established contact tracing systems at regional health levels, while Victoria has it centralised. I wonder if that might be a significant factor in this regard? Maybe the contact tracers in Sydney working on measles, tb etc for years past are in fact better bi-lingually for the area they work in & if that therefore transferred across to covid too without anyone noticing the difference in the different states?",Lilac Lizard,2020-10-10T12:56:57Z

"‚Äã@Alessandro Sartori South Korea & others had experience with SARS1 & lots of deaths with that, so that was why they were prepared, but in reality South Korea is a bad example, they came to attention due to failing to contain the virus & then managing to get control later. Most Asian countries did far better, never losing control in the first place. South Korea spoke of apps, but in reality they were tracking phones & atms & invading privacy & despite all of that, their contact tracing was in fact a disaster. The only reason they managed control was because their virus was confined to a religious cult, so they only had to track down all cult members to track down all virus cases, which was pretty easy when the cult insisted on attending their church each week despite the outbreak. When the virus in South Korea made it out of that cult & entered a rainbow person bar, they found that their discriminatory practices against those people lead to a total failure in all tracking systems & loss of control of the virus & a need to close almost everything down to contain it.

South Korea did well with PR, but in reality that's all. They also benefited greatly from the world effectively banning anyone from traveling there, which prevented any re-introductions of the virus. Other countries did much better than them.

Italy, like you say was caught out, same as Asia was with SARS1. Could have happened to anyone, nothing Italy did wrong other than wrong place, wrong time.

Xi Jinpin to quash the reports from one Dr Le who tried to warn the public in China and was arrested, later somehow the Dr contracted the coronavirus and died. The reports from China were barely heeded in the States. This narrative should have been implemented to the video and integrated properly. 
Also the downplaying of the Governor Insley by WH resident all played into this disaster! Remember the Coronavirus is not a flu!
The moment the words Endemic, Pandemic, deaths comes into play we have a problem from before the first patient was identified. Once the deaths started the President Bush and President Obama Pandemic Emergency plans needed to take root, regardless of who's in Office at the time, all the flags were up and screaming DEAL WITH THIS NOW!

This video assumes the CCP would be helping the world to fight the Pandemic, meanwhile, in reality, China had been quietly buying up all mask surpluses in the world. 
I'm not Pro-Trump. I'm Pro-Reality. Thinking that the blame is wholly Trump's is completely false. Trump has not done the best job, but to blame Trump without blame on WHO (the organization with the job to prevent pandemics), China, and politicians that simply are against Trump is wrong. I have to give massive props to TNYT because  of their inclusion of local politicians encouraging massive gatherings. DeBlasio isn't wholly responsible for NY, but his actions helped the virus grow.  Trump isn't wholly responsible for the US, but his ego helped the virus grow. The CCP isn't Wholly responsible for the virus, but their reluctance to co-operate with the world and to save face, helped the virus grow. 

I don't want to stick to 'my side' on politics, many people were responsible and this could have been safer for so many more people and the economy could have been so much better than it is now.

"While the intentionally released CCP virus is real enough, the massive propaganda effort to induce panic and compliance is purely manufactured.  The response to the ""pandemic"" is not based on sound health policy, but rather it is primarily political.  We know that it's political because the Democratic mayors and governors don't even try to hide the arbitrary nature of how it's enforced.  If you display politically correct thought (BLM, ANTIFA), the lock downs don't apply to you, but if you display politically incorrect thought (Churches, anti-lock down protests), you will be persecuted and arrested.

When you watch Bill Gates hype the mythical CCP vaccine, it‚Äôs important to remember that Microsoft, the CIA, and World Economic Forum (among others) were key organizers of ""Event 201"".  The conference, held last October in Manhattan, was around modeling the response to a hypothetical corona virus pandemic.  One of the points that was stressed repeatedly was the importance of CONTROLLING THE NARRATIVE.  Not controlling the disease, CONTROLLING THE NARRATIVE.  And that's exactly what they're doing.

"Wow, I subscribed for NYT daily news feed, but- unsubscribed after 2 days. I guess the days of straight news reporting is over. Between the fear mongering and pure opinion (Trump derangement syndrome) dripping in every single sentence is incredibly disappointing. There is no place left in America where news & verified facts are presented anymore. Although I deeply saddened, I fear more for the younger generations- who can they turn to for factual data to interpret? Hillary's loss, in conjunction with a similarly timed reporter interventional piece (You MUST interpret & OPINE on all data) along with a completely misinformed fear for the sanctity of the Constitution and what it represents (America!) has lead to almost 4 straight years of Trump bashing.
   I understand not liking the person, heck, I'm not even sure how much I want to have a cup of coffee with him, but, the Office of the President is being disrespected completely. The POTUS is the single most powerful, influential human in the world, and, the Office of the President should always be treated as such. Social Media, reality TV and full spin news cycles has forgotten the basic rules of the game.
   Fear Mongering, and, devaluing the Office is what gets 'hits', clicks & tweets, right? I sincerely hope that something (anything?) happens to remind our Fifth Estate to moderate its Liberal bias, and, return to news reporting- without artifice, sarcasm & strongly overstated opinion. However, until the last viewer turns off the Left: NBC, ABC, CBS, CNN & MSDNC, along with the now archaic 'print media', you will devolve into click bait just like the election channels (NewsMax, Viable et alia) and also just like them-disappear as soon as the existential threat to our way of life is ended.
   For this news consumer, I hope that you have a nice 4 year run with the successful re-election of President Trump, and, then make like a balloon with a slow and embarrassingly gassy leak.",David C. Gulliver,2020-10-06T23:27:15Z
Very disappointed in what looked to be an autopsy of this massive disaster.  Without a doubt the president has been a disaster in regards to communication about masks and social distancing.

I am in no way letting trump off the hook for this complete disaster, but why did we not hear from Bush and Obama about what Trump should be doing, vis a vi, their plans? In addition, it is my understanding that the pentagon has their own three ring binders for such cases. I am sure plenty of people have worked with those plans over the decades, what do all of these plans say and why weren't the architects of these plans not screaming from the roof tops what we should be doing. I heard plenty of Trumps not doing it right, but what is/was the right way? Again, I despise Trump as much as the next guy but this is a matter of life a death for 200k people and growing.

It's not free but affordable for the huge majority of the people. From what I know in the US either you have pretty good insurance or you're in a bad place. Our economy also went down the drain with the lockdown but we've flattened the curve of the spread, and that gave time for the hospitals to handle the crisis. The majority of the people are aware of the dangers and most wear masks in the street, in stores, or closed spaces it's mandatory.

"Hello from quarantine. I am in quarantine with my 83 year old mother who has heart and lung issues, so this isn't optional. I live in a very Red area and only about half of the people take the virus seriously, still.  Their lack of concern has been a bit of a rollercoaster ride.  It's reflected in our case count.  Currently we are expecting our biggest surge to date with hundreds of new cases each day, yet I get asked often why are we still in quarantine.  We have a state mask mandate, but still only about half of the people are bothering.  My spies tell me that social distancing is a joke as restaurants and bars are not in want of customers.  To top things off there is a big group of anti-vaccine folks who have let it be known that they have no interest in getting a vaccine when it comes out.  Even folks who are pro vaccine say they are afraid to get one because it's being rushed.  Now we have a positive Covid-19 Trump telling his people that they shouldn't be afraid of the virus.  God only knows what the long term effects of that misinformation will be, but I'm sure we will feel it.  I want out of quarantine, but my own family, friends and neighbors are holding me hostage.  I found this video very interesting and I appreciate the information.  From my perspective it's been obvious that the government messed this up, but what we need to do now is figure out how to correct the mistakes.  Surely there is one town, one community that got it all wrong and then turned this around. Find that place and make a video about how they fixed things so we can learn from them.

"Through my part time work, no not delivery, think government contract. at the height of the announcements of all of these icu's being used to capacity... Complete and utter b******* and lies out of the 10 hospitals that I was privy to ICU use was normal, yeah hospitals were under lockdown and no one was allowed to come in, think of the logic behind that why were hospitals told the lockdown and at the same time claim that their icu's were overrun?

I talked to ambulance drivers, they saw no uptick, and in Chicago ambulance drivers were told to run lights and sirens as often as possible.

It's actually a violation of law. But they went along and they did it.

That was to continue from March until June. 

The only thing that resulted from those behaviors was utter panic for those who believed the LIE that hospitals were being overrun.

Doctors and nurses with large enough salaries and probably bribes or coercion for fear of losing their job we're reporting.

The matter of fact I believe anyone that reported that this virus is in any way real beyond the typical flu has their job on the line when they're told to report nonsense

either that or everything I've just said is just a movie plot.

Not a lot of outbreak in Chicago if you look at the numbers overall.

Test increased exponentially in April and May end of April and all of May and has continually increased the graph that you are showing is not adjusted for that rise in testing and it's obvious.

They're testing in Europe was largely complete as far as it could be for those who wanted to test, and only a handful of countries was testing mandatory.

You really think that every single promise in China did testing? You can't use the China numbers, China lies, that is their baseline. Remove China from the rest of the world graph see what happens to the line then.",Dan Lo-Fat,2020-10-06T18:33:48Z

"If you're not interest very important things perhaps endemic so to speak of the US in its response to any information coming out to the public from all sources not just television not just live news.
It was massive instantaneous hoarding, unexplicably confusing retailers hit by the hoarding behavior.
They were either told to let the hoarding occur, but they were not surprised at all in any way nor have they had any intention of restocking soon. Multiple products especially masks are not available because of fear that coronavirus might be latent in those masks because they were made in China. There's a complete falsehood in life the overwhelming majority of simple low-cost masses have been and are still made today in India. Handled by small children on dirty floors in their dwellings. they still could be laden with gorilla or any other type of virus however remember Corona doesn't last very long at all in air is shipping crap from China or India takes a minimum of 3 weeks well past the quarantine time period more b******* on the part of retailers not stocking things that you would need period if barbershops and hairstyle are closed they're going to need clippers and shavers and cutters.

As if Trump was the only President warned by Who and China... What about the rest of the world... When Trump imposes travel ban WHO accused him.... You know what WHO at last announces its pandemic at last on 11th March.... It's too late... Meanwhile the Chinese communist Party never ever announce it's contagious and pandemic until late March
.... On January Taiwan find out on their own that it's contagious human to human... When they informed about this to WHO... It was rejected..totally rejected from the WHO....

And if you remember when April came Trump‚Äôs attention and focus shifted to his re-election bid. In short he walked away from the pandemic.  Plus the rhetoric was one of chaos when starting urging his base to take back their lives and not wear masks, which help to spread the virus even further.

"I just want to say that a very similar thing has happened in the U.K - supremely prepared for a pandemic, but this preparedness was constrained by a decade of austerity and cutbacks. We also didn't learn from prior mistakes, have eye watering levels of incompetence within the government (the person in charge of our covid-19 track and trace system is a former CEO of a phone company, not an experienced epidemiologist), confused and inarticulate health communications, a leader who didn't take it seriously to begin with (according to Johnson the U.K was going to 'zig' whilst other nations 'zagged' to benefit financially from the virus) and would rather put in effort distracting the public from the crisis by manufacturing culture wars and pulling grand, unworkable schemes from thin air. But the worst thing, unlike Trump, is that the government have argued that it is our national duty as citizens to follow the regulations set - which change on a weekly basis, are often contradictory and literally depend on 'the common sense of the British people'  - and have themselves not followed them and have not been punished when government officials break them. 

There is a common theme running between the countries which have performed comparatively poorly across the globe - populist leadership, specifically populist male leadership. Russia, Brazil, the Philippines, India, U.K, USA have all done horrifically, and are run by so called strong men who are liberal with facts during 'normal' times and have intensified this tendency (certainly in the U.K) during a time where facts, the truth and statistical evidence are essential in combatting the pandemic. It is this development and their supporters and cheer leaders who are to blame for the worst excesses of this pandemic. If one positive arises from the hideous mess of 2020, I hope it is the precipitous decline of populism.",Will Brown,2020-10-06T11:05:52Z

How  a country with no  medical insurance for everyone and a comparably  little social security and a relatively much of social disunity could remain calm enough for to behave reasonably and disciplined during the pandemic? For me its not  surprising. China is much much better in that respect. They are very connected people. Really connected. And now people are blaming responsible individuals like Trump.

France      120 pps KM,                             Pop - 67 million.                  # of infections 593,248    ---- population infected 0.885%
Belgium    383.8 pps KM,                         Pop - 11.46 million,            # of infections 130,141    ----- population infected 1.135%
Denmark 134.9pps KM                           Pop. - 5.81 million               # of infections 29,680      ------ population infected 0.511%
USA             36.2 pps KM,                        Pop - 328.2 million,              # of infections 7,305,270 ---- population infected 2.226%

So the Belgium has over 10 times more people per square kilometre but has an infection percentage almost half that in the USA.
In Germany you are five times less likely to catch the infection than the USA, but the USA has 9 times less people per square kilometre. 

9.78% of the total world's population lives in Europe, 4.25% of the total world's lives in the USA. 
Of 35,109,317 cases worldwide in 206 countries. The USA has 20.807% of all worldwide cases.  so less than 5% of the world's population has over 20% of the world's cases

And before tests per 1,000 is mentioned... 
The USA 357 test per 1,000 pop
Luxembourg 1,348 tests per 1,000 people (that's right 134.8% testing rate)
Denmark 673.2 tests per 1,000 population
The UK 312.42 tests per 1,000 population
Belgium 291.4 tests per 1,000 population
Germany 202 tests per 1,000 population 

this might be a factor in some countries, but in countries with socialised healthcare eg northern Europe they are testing hotspots and have free public testing and a more comprehensive contract tracing system than generally in the USA, meaning testing needs have dropped, though could still potentially be improved.

one thing to think about 377 people work in the White house if they are all being tested every 3 days, some reports say every two days, how much is that and other state governmental offices bumping the national figures for the general population. Boris Johnson for example has been tested, but the first test was when he presented mild symptoms, and now is only if he is going to a meeting with other politicians that can not be done virtually. The UK media attacked the UK government for 2 members of the government being tested, but the White House is testing hundreds every couple of days and state houses are doing the same...",Daniel Warren,2020-10-06T05:54:22Z

"Allow me to quote my epidemiology text book
""Epidemiology studies tend to produce less reliable data that can be more difficult to interpret.¬† For instance, it is¬†extremely rare that an epidemiology study¬†alone can confirm that a particular chemical or viral exposure caused a health effect. ¬†Moreover, as noted by Stanford University professor Dr. John Ioannidis, the vast majority of published epidemiology studies are¬†later proven to be wrong.

Furthermore, with the exception of randomized-control trials that research potentially beneficial therapeutic pharmaceuticals, it is considered unethical to randomly allocate humans into exposed and unexposed groups. So epidemiologists can only observe, not control, the conditions under which people are exposed. Consequently, a vast, unknown number of other variables, referred to as¬†confounders, may cloud our understanding of the relationship between an exposure and observed health effects.¬†

Errors in measurements of exposure and disease also can occur, which can further skew findings. Potential confounding and measurement errors are especially problematic in studies that include a relatively small number of subjects (i.e., less than tens of thousands), report exposures near background levels and¬†report weaker relationships (e.g., increased risks less than 3 fold between groups).¬†Finally, not all epidemiology study designs produce equally strong evidence (see Figure, ‚ÄúEvidence Hierarchy of Epidemiological Study Design‚Äù).",TheFreePantheist,2020-10-06T02:23:15Z

Moreover, on what historical basis do western journalists criticize the timing of release of information about novel viruses? Was there a government in history who has sequenced a novel virus' genome within two weeks  of discovery of the pathogen and shared it with labs around the world? Has there been a country who has encountered a novel viral pneumonia that because epidemic and then contained in within 4 months? Westerner have been looking for the perfect government response in China when they themselves are still fumbling around like a baby trying to juggle. Look to China as a government who has done everything in playbook to prevent and stop epidemics and succeeded instead of being dismissive of everything it has done from the start.

"Sadly this report is reeking of anti-Trump sentiment. Playbook, CDC and all the rest of the Coronavirus arsenal the US has access to does not mean a thing. Everyone can hypothesise all the want - and look at data and graphs all they want. Like, currently, as of today I see total figures of 7,676,378 cases / 214,970 deaths in the US and 5,935,384 cases / 237,497 deaths (and Europe is on the rise and US is falling in numbers). That‚Äôs a difference of 1,7 mil. (and a percentage of deaths favouring Europe with 0.2% of population dying vs US‚Äô 2.8%).¬†Those numbers are making the total numbers between the two regions even less that the numbers Johnny was presenting here... I‚Äôm sure the gap in total number may shrink even more...¬†

Nobody has the silver bullet solution or plan. All that is clear is that there are many untold financial, social, and mental health associated side affects yet to be realised to see the full picture.

Johnny Harris is brilliant! So excited to see him on NYTimes!,Thu Le,2020-10-06T00:24:22Z
"The real timeline for this disease proper begins in Sept. 2019, not Dec  The real timeline about preparations includes the ideology imposed during the Obama years to suppress honest thinking about travel restrictions.
The timeline picks up in late Nov.-early Dec. 2019, when China-critical sources report how serious this new outbreak is. And our media and institutions do their best to downplay it.
The epidemic was covered up in this period not just by China but, soon, also by WHO (at China's behest) out of deference to its political leadership's conception of its diplomatic protocol. Also minimized by CDC, and by our major media - our collective NY Times, so to speak.
There was the nonsense about no aerosol transmission. That face masks are useless and counterproductive because our people are too dumb to use them right. Dr Fauci and many others said this. They later lied even when admitting their original lie, and said their only motivation for lying was the noble one that we didn't have enough masks. But their social put-down motivation was there in the public record, expressed openly for all to see like a classic Fredian slip.
And then the nonsense from these same institutions that our people shouldn't panic, the panic and panicky ""misinformation"" is more dangerous that the virus itself, it's an ""epidemic of misinformation"" (meaning by this, mostly, the relatively few people who were correcting WHO's and CDC's official false and misleading statements). And that it's like another flu, people our people stupidly fear and panic about and ""other"" things that are new and foreign and different. 
These were all ideologically motivated lines, all established as public dogma by your own cohort. The motivation consisted of the psychological and social as well as political-ideological needs of our progressive classes, which habitually look for a way to deploy this language to deplore our people in every new situation and position themselves as morally and intellectually superior.
It also fit in with the political-ideological attacks that soon followed, which called it ""racist"" and ""xenophobic"" to impose travel restrictions on China. Repeating here not just China's tactical word choices but a language for suppressing honesty that was developed and entrenched in our own media and institutions. China was using this ideological shaming language, which China itself despised (China really is racist and proud of it), only because it knew it was the invincible language of our progressive media for suppressing honest thinking and getting the West to do what China wanted. It eventually stopped working even for this purpose, but only when it was too late for us and Europe. The ideological language about travel restrictions being ""racist"" and ""xenophobic"" had been already imposed as a collective social dogma in CDC and WHO in the Obama years during the epidemics back then, something easy to do since it had been imposed among our media and academic classes, including medics, years earlier. This was the root cause of Dr Fauci's resistance to travel restrictions until it was too late, and the collective progressive class's use of it to deplore travel restrictions at the end of Jan. 2020. Which is what prevented them from being carried out consistently, and from getting extended in a timely way to other countries that were refusing to restrict travel with China, in Europe because they and their media were repeating after our media in deploring America's restrictions on China; something they perhaps inevitably did since they've made an entrenched practice of repeating after our media in deploring everything about Trump, true or false no matter just as it is no matter to our own dominant media. 
What became of the lies about how there's no evidence of aerosol transmission? Months later this language was changed by WHO and CDC, but only to ""no perfect proof of it"", still denying that the fact that it was real after the consequences of the lie had gone global. Only recently admitting what was obvious to honest observers from the start. 
What became of the lies on facemasks? They went through the same long, ambiguous process for correcting their lie on facemasks. Only changed it for a long time to ""facemasks help only the other person not yourself."" Finally now admitting that that's not true either. In the meantime, they convinced Trump to take up their line on this, then attacked him for it, then he dug in with his instinct of punching back at their attacks, and we ended up with the usual two camps of liars on both sides who take it for granted that they're on the side the truth because they're against the other one.
And what of the language for discouraging taking this seriously and responding on an adequate scale, by saying ""don't panic"", stop ""overreacting"", the panic and overreaction are more dangerous than the virus itself? Our media and institutions really did convince Trump on this one == that this is his job description as President, to prevent what the media will call ""panic"" and ""overreaction"". Which are more deplore word for our dumb people. What is put down as ""panic"" includes ever healthy psychological reaction, all the ones that are needed to orient people's minds toward dealing seriously and adequately with a pandemic, since a pandemic is a problem that mushrooms out of control at an exponential pace and any sufficient reaction will look initially like a wild panicky overreaction. To be sure, Trump had less of the malicious motivation against our people; his motivation was more the Kudlow one of not wanting a Wall St. panic. This is a perfectly normal and even justified motivation during normal financial crises. But was dead wrong in the present, pandemic-based crisis.And Trump dug himself in on this, too, like the facemasks, in his and the media's back and forth on it, when the media turned around and blamed him for saying and doing what the media had strictly instructed him that he must say and do.
There's also the CDC-FDA testing fiasco, which you try to blame on Trump rather than on their institutional attitudes of being in command. The reality was that you were all instructing Trump that he must listen to them and obey them and stand up for them, or else. And definitely not override our institutions and scientists on this. Now you complain that he didn't override them. Probably he simply gave in to your intimidation. But you'lll never investigate the evidence for that. Our media were all threatening that if he overrode CDC and FDA and Fauci on this and didn't stand behind him and say they were doing great, he would be attacked for destroying our institutions, not trusting ""the science"", and would have to be impeached for this too. He obeyed. Soon you turned around and attacked him for obeying your commands. Putting yourself finally on the side of truth, mostly by accident however and for the sake of your polemical hatreds.

 having our enemies atone for the damage they've caused in the 
past and whatever they've tried in the future, no raise in taxes, lower 
prescription prices, better health insurance, a newer brighter skyline for 
America, better and easier care for our Veterans, more jobs for our citizens, 
America whole and self-reliant, a space program that would be surpassed by
none, we could continue ""the right to try"" (something with the Dems. in control 
for so long
 never giving us a choice for the health of our own bodies), the right 
to decide where & how we want our children to learn & have their educations, 
and most importantly we can keep & maintain The RULES of FREEDOM our

who are ill, get well soon.  We are truly in this together.  Be proud you are part 
of a land that is free. Being together will keep it that way.  This is what we vote 
for when we vote for President Trump for another 4 years   If he is still weak 
when he leaves the hospital, then we can be the strength he'll need to recuperate 
even faster.   If it is his decision to step aside, our system will then continue in the 
direction he has started.  We can make him more proud of us than ever.  And if 
the stock market momentarily dips and dives that too will recoup.  It has many

times. So who said life was or is an arrow only straight up?  We've built our lives

close with our thanks to our President Donald J. Trump and his family.  Let it close 
with prayers for our loved ones not with us this year's end that they forever rest in 
peace. Let it close with this invisible killer behind us.  Let it close with those who 
hurt the world, remain accountable.     Let it close with those whose intentions are 
to take more of what they have not built away from it's rightful owners and say

''No More. And NEVER EVER AGAIN.""   Let it close with a bond among all races, 
religions, and
 all it's people here in America and in the world.  Let it close with

"RIP Grand Aunt,

It was shocking and sad finding out that I had a Grand Aunt in New York City in my whole life, only to have learned also that she had died from this disease in her 87 years of life. 

My Mother never bothered telling me my whole actually history of my family from her side, until I learned through extended family that I had gotten enough touch with some over the years, since I knew of them, on social media that mentioned it and showed on my newsfeed.

"The main problem I have when comparing the EU to the US is that we often compare the responses of individual members of the EU to the entire united states while forgetting that the united states has 3/4 the population of the entire EU spread over 2.2 times the landmass. People don't realize the psychological complications this added to the pandemic. Our entire country went into lock down almost at the same time. Businesses in small rural areas with only 400 residents were being told to lock their doors despite the fact that it was only people thousands of miles away in New York being hit hard. The fact that they were being forced to close over something that was mostly being experienced in Large metropolitan areas led to them becoming skeptical, and so when they finally had enough and reopened in June, they actually experienced their first wave. This was compounded by the George Floyd protests (which our medical community actively endorsed).",Hamboogler,2020-10-05T20:38:01Z

Fact: during that 35 day span, every 10,000 deaths happened in a 4-, 5-, or 6-day span. As you can obviously tell from simple maths, we were averaging 2,000 deaths EVERYDAY!!!

"This article is incredibly biased, one dimensional and selective.  I remember when Trump closed the air links to Europe and was called a racist for doing so.  Europe was far worse than the US for a long time.  Italy nearly collapsed under the slaughter.  Spain is much worse than the US (when you look at cases and deaths per million people).   UK has been hit very hard too.

Citing New York is biased too.  New York suffered from a direct transmission of the disease to New York via airlines from Europe.  Most of the north eastern states were also heavily infected, not just NYC.  France, Spain, Italy had horrible levels of infection and death, much worse than the US at the time.  They are also showing increasing levels of infection and  death again.

This is very very biased and ascribing such success to Europe is simply wrong.  Seems to me this is just a bunch of left liberals exaggerating everything as an effort to condemn Trump, selectively using evidence to back up their case and ignoring what does not support their view.",dnmurphy48,2020-10-05T12:03:08Z

"Thirteen years ago, a group of U.S. public health officials came up with a plan to address what they regarded as one of the medical system‚Äôs crucial vulnerabilities: a shortage of ventilators.

The breathing-assistance machines tended to be bulky, expensive and limited in number. The plan was to build a large fleet of inexpensive portable devices to deploy in a flu pandemic or another crisis. Money was budgeted. A federal contract was signed. Work got underway.


And then things suddenly veered off course. A multibillion-dollar maker of medical devices bought the small California company that had been hired to design the new machines. The project ultimately produced zero ventilators.

because the US is the source of bio tech & dysfunctional research that creates viruses in an attempt to have a pre emptive vaccine - even if Covid wasn't a lab leak (wuhan is China's pre-eminent Bio tech & has had leaks before...but anyway) there is much greater risk of pandemic bc of these labs & lab funding the US has exported bc Congress restricted such research. The old school Fauci medical community believed in herd immunity & it couldn't be stopped. This is the underlying issue - like telling people not to wear masks - I think that alone would have given US a similar curve to Europe. This is why you don't want a President who doesn't listen to people but also knows when not to listen & Trump got these mostly wrong...but the bio tech sector is now a risk like the military industrial complex.,Noss Cern,2020-10-05T09:10:53Z

"Trump banned flights from China in late January.
In early February flights directly from Wuhan, hubei province, China arrived in  New York City, Los Angeles, Portland, Seattle and Chicago all hotspots by March.
I've seen the flight manifest/logs.
People at the state department allowed these flights in, both Democrats and Republicans, against Trump's orders.
Nancy Pelosi herself told people to come out and party in Chinatown...
this was intentional covid-19 is a bioweapon.
Now it has been weaponized against Trump.
Trump did everything he could to stop it but was sabotaged.
This is going to blow up in your faces NYT.
The numbers are lies, the graphs are lies. I have never met anyone who had it or even knew anybody else who had it.
I have a family member who works in medicine who says at the hospital they are classifying people who died in car wrecks as ""cause of death: covid-19"" so they can get that covid-19 death money. Look it up.
I know medical personnel who never saw anyone with it.
The numbers are inflated for political reasons... That is ""why?"" John.",Love America,2020-10-05T06:14:14Z

"I strongly disagree that we had, ""leaders that just gave up on the whole thing."" NO! They did NOT give up. They CHOSE to take a different path, because people's health and lives were NOT their priority! Protecting profits and political power were clearly MUCH higher on their To-Do lists than keeping Grandma alive. 
Remember the Grand Old Perv that declared that old people would be more than willing to die for the cause? And what was the cause? Keeping profits flowing. Trickle-down economics at it's most obvious. 
It still perplexes me, though, as to why the Republicans who adhere to that philosophy are so willing to be urinated on. I used to think they didn't like Golden Showers (being the Moral Majority and all that), until they elected a guy that has both a golden shower AND a golden toilet.

1)- Calling the 1918 Flu ""the Spanish Flu"" is just continuing to promote WWI propaganda.

It would have been MUCH more accurately described as ""the Kansas Flu"", in acknowledgement of the DISASTER in 3 Army training camps where soldiers were infected en-masse, then put on ships and sent all over the world to super-spread the contagion; and,
2)- The Trump Mal-Administration, as well as ignoring the 'play-book"", in 2018 they also disbanded the National Security Council Directorate for Global Health Security and Bio-defence.

As if Trump was the only President warned by Who and China... What about the rest of the world... When Trump imposes travel ban WHO accused him.... You know what WHO at last announces its pandemic at last on 11th March.... It's too late... Meanwhile the Chinese communist Party never ever announce it's contagious and pandemic until late March
.... On January Taiwan find out on their own that it's contagious human to human... When they informed about this to WHO... It was rejected..totally rejected from the WHO....

"Madam Meouff Indeed, failure to ignore 'taboos', like mentioning Hitler, are a worthy thing. Failure to really dig in and understand how an incredibly advanced, cultured, educated, Democratic, 'Christian' country, like Germany, could hand itself over to Fascism should be a matter of intense study in every school.
Watching the Nazi rally in Madison Square Garden still gives me chills. As do the pictures of the KKK marches stomping down main streets of American Capital Cities (I wonder if Covid Don's dad was under one of those hoods? Probably.)
Though what you say regarding Australia, New Zealand and Canada is true, there are some wrinkles to your theory:
Australia - had the 'Eureka Stockade' moment which was the culmination of a low-grade revolution to get out from under the dominance of 'Land Owners';
New Zealand - remains the ONLY country to EVER force the Brits into a Treaty (which, amazingly, they more or less honoured - unlike America);
Canada - had the War of 1812, and gradually removed dependence and control from the Brits through negotiation and acts of Parliament.
There is always a 'Colonial Guilt' that comes out in people. Those that steal other's resources, land and slave labor almost always requires the invaders to declare the indigenous peoples as 'savages' and less than human, therefore absolving themselves of guilt for their barbarities and ongoing repression and dispossession. We need to ignore as far as possible the fact that our wealth rests on the fact that it came from our great grandad beating up and robbing the neighbour, burning down his house, then arguing that he deserved it. 
If you can declare a fellow as only ""3/5s human""; or refuse to count them in the Census; claim you don't need to honor a treaty because 'they' are not as civilized as you; or claim 'they' are incapable of being educated, so you have to ban them from education, ALL show a CLEAR awareness of guilt.

"The CDC published information advising people not to wear masks back in may, it's the way the death rate is being recorded (Anyone with Covid-19 dying is listed as a Covid death, inlcuding being shot) that was described as a hoax, and Masks don't prevent people catching it, they prevent people from spreading it.

I would understand that Republicans were told wearing a mask wasn‚Äôt necessary due to Covid being less than 1% chance of catching.

"@Slender EnderBros Considering the way that death rates are recorded, I doubt that 150,000+ people wouldn't have died from similar conditions.

"I like the enthusiasm of the presenter however my thoughts liken this report to period op-eds on how incredible the Maginot Line would be to the defence of France - it was a fantastic work of military engineering but neglected to consider the friendly neighbour Belgium as an attack vector! Yeah great that America as you state  ""wrote the global playbook for pandemic response"" but that only covered most of the pandemics to date at the time of publication. Just like Maginot factored in most of the previous European invasion activity of the prior millennia into designing a very expensive line that would have withstood all of the known major offensives!   

Sadly (in hindsight) America's playbook while scientifically sound (and if followed will likely be highly effective for the majority of future pandemics) has to make narrow assumptions (based on practicality) and will be fundamentally challenged. Despite being solidly based on volumes of prior research on the spread and typical modus operandi of the myriad of predecessor numerically high casualty lethal global pandemics and fatal coronaviruses Covid-19 does NOT follow the steps in that playbook. Almost all of those pandemics have a rapid onset of measurable conditions and feature notable degradation within a few days of contracting. Most of the expected pandemic symptoms are severe enough that there are few mysteries about those who will be spreading the virus. 

Covid-19 is highly infectious and shares many end-state lethality traits of prior pandemics but only in a minority of patients. Unlike the playbook assumptions, Covid-19 symptoms are highly varied, can be confused with other minor ailments in some and are barely discernable in many thus something like a simple infection zone border temperature ""check"" will be ineffective. Periodicity is another factor where Covid-19  operates on a very long multi week cycle that may only manifest maximum lethality in a few patients towards the end of the infection period. Spread by highly infectious asymptomatic individuals over several weeks of time is another feature of Covid-19 that would be nigh on impossible to factor into any playbook. Global contact tracing has proven to be effective to a point but given the long dwell factor is generally unsustainable. To counter this a playbook would have to factor in (staff-up and budget for) mechanisms to enable regular mass testing of populations of each state in the country - I can't see any country willing to fund that. 

As for the reported high proportion of deaths in the US. One has to consider contributing factors like long life expectancy, low general levels of fitness, social mobility, individual freedoms, questionable hygiene and so on. A totalitarian regime with no individual freedoms can mandate all manner of pandemic stifling population restrictions at the point of a gun (and can bury the negative statistics if things get out of hand). A third world country that has poor infrastructure, minimal medical support and poor reporting may never actually report anything like a realistic statistic. The US is certainly among the best at accurately tracking the number of Covid-19 attributable deaths so I would challenge that much of the remaining global death statistics are grossly under-reported.",Martin Waterhouse,2020-10-05T02:30:39Z

"I'd like to see a graph that shows the utter disintegration of  the New York Times, from a highly respected newspaper reporting on important stories and while having a liberal editorial board, was at least objective when the stories were told. Now that was a long, long time ago, and while I think it's liberalism infected its stories from at least the late 1970s, what has happened in the past decade is jaw dropping. 

This is a hit piece on the Trump Administration, it's not really as if they hide it, though they put a good deal of production into this, but it's unfortunate -- the story here is a real one. Where officials underestimated its seriousness, who they were, what kind of responses -- these are all valuable questions, but instead of taking them seriously, this just bashes American response policies, and hits Trump. The Monday morning quarterbacking is everywhere, the ""if only we had ...""  Yes, these are always what critics of any sort will do -- but they are also the ones that are easiest to dismiss. They don't help, they don't inform, and they here have ulterior purpose -- the agenda here is the election, that's not too hard to tell. 

The guy they get to act as the main speaker's guide to this is Nicholas Kristof, the guy who manages to be wrong on a remarkably consistent basis across the spectrum of policies, though he specializes in foreign affairs. Why he's their guy for a health issue is questionable. 

This has very little to say about Covid, and how it was handled, there is very little insight, nothing that has not been in the news, nothing that informative. What it shows is the New York Times in its advance state of decay. Not many people, perhaps its die hard fans who occupy the niche  on the far left to whom it now caters. It is more than that though, it is no longer a newspaper, it is an advocacy organization, producing pieces like this to advocate its cause, which is to move the country, in whatever way it can, to the hard left, the most extreme positions possible.",Grater Deddly,2020-10-05T00:00:39Z

This is an ignorant commentary. You‚Äôre basing your opinion on conjecture and America mythology,Gertrude west,2020-10-04T23:44:49Z
"Honestly, this was a pretty superficial look at the response, I must say. Basically you think the media spent to much time on‚Ä¶the Grammy‚Äôs.. instead of covering the virus? In realty, the media had already jumped on the premise of ‚Äúnew pandemic‚Äù, for sensationalist news, like they always do. I‚Äôm not sure what more coverage would have even done to prevent the spread. 

Moreover, you seem to have left out Trump‚Äôs travel ban with China, enacted promptly in February? You know, to prevent a disease that originated in China, and whose government was the one ACTUALLY giving false information and botching the handling for the virus. This was probably the single most effective thing that prevented the virus from spreading more rapidly in the US. The same travel ban prominent Democrats like Chuck Schumer disingenuously decreed as ‚Äúracist‚Äù? They chose to be willfully ignorant instead of making concrete responses to the pandemic like President Trump did.

You do realize your new ‚Äúideas‚Äù of ‚ÄúTrump should have picked up the phone to talk to Xi!‚Äù And ‚ÄúTrump should have had the same ‚Äúgusto‚Äù as he did for a wall!‚Äù Are easy say-nothings, completely ignorant of the way government operates?

The death-rates of course you also leave out now that 94% had pre-existing conditions, and that people were dying of diabetes, cancer, and even gunshots with COVID in their system being recorded as directly caused by COVID. Extremely dishonest reporting, but of course with a ideological haphazard and falsity-prone like the New York times, sadly expected. 

Case in point: The propagandistic juxtaposition of Trump with un-sourced footage of medical professionals talking about patients. Of course, the economic fallout of shutdowns which other countries like Sweden (who never shut down), show this as completely unwarranted, most likely did contribute more to human suffering than the COVID cases. The fact that this is not news, but a complete appeal to emotion to further a political goal. 

I know critical thinking in our country is down directly because people‚Äôs ‚Äúnews‚Äù is heaped with ideological propaganda like this. This shoddy hit-piece offers no new information, only serves to further cement the narrative the media is pushing.",Calla Wright,2020-10-04T23:44:36Z

Here's what an opinion looks like: This crisis and its impact on the economy is like the Stanford Marshmallow Experiment. We needed a president who could recognize that we needed to hold off on eating the marshmallow for a few minutes so that we could get two later, we needed a president who could recognize that the choice was between severe short term economic pain and severe protracted economic pain. TBH, the reasons Trump couldn't do that are very similar to the conclusions about which children couldn't delay gratification: inability to trust the people running the test/experts, frequently tied up with an inability to trust adults due to a unstable home life.",Karlie Bellatrix Young,2020-10-04T17:48:21Z

"We stayed home a solid 2.5 weeks, but when we ran out of food i went out to get some. There was nothing on the shelfs. Not only did i have to go to 5 stores, i could only get 3 days worth of food.  Each store was packed full of people to the limit of capacity and had an average of a hour long wait line to get in. Only about 5% of people i saw then had masks but they bathed in sanitizer when the went in and came out of the store. Most just had gloves on thats it.

After week 4 i had to go out daily to get only one days worth of food shopping to as many stores as i could. I ended up having to go to MicDonalds each morning for breakfast and sometimes lunch or dinner. We cut our meals down to 2 a day and sometimes 1 meal and one small snack. 

We had to spend much more money then normal on living costs during the shutdown because of extra travel and forced to buy higher priced items we normally would not buy and eating out daily. People in worse financial positions then us had an even harder time and were less able to remain at home at all. 

The lack of supply meeting demand and stores able to maintain enough shipments to remained stocked with even just the basics is why our area failed at the shutdown.",Tansey Dunn,2020-10-04T17:02:54Z

"When talking about the fact that the US only shut down 39%, I think it's important to emphasize that a lot of the people with jobs that can't be done remotely were still expected to work. The number of ""essential employees"" was way too high. There are some truly essential jobs, but over a third of workers were classified as essential, and many more ""nonessential"" workers never got to stay home (because there was not nearly enough money provided by the govt to enable that). There were some who refused to stay home because they're into QAnon or #Liberate or whatever, but much more troublingly, a large segment of the population wanted to stay healthy but was forced to work by the threat of starvation.

The government paid everyone & asked them to stay home as much as possible in return for that money, allowed almost all shops & businesses to stay open, so people could go out & buy their jigsaw puzzles & home office set ups with the money they were getting, but asked people to please stay home as much as possible, so of course everyone lapped up the government funded time at home with family, doing long desired crafts, building gardens, home improvement projects, quality family time etc etc etc. 
90% of people in Australia stayed home the majority of the time until the virus was controlled, then people started going out again, mothers day saw people deciding to go shopping on mass, cause the virus was gone & there was no restrictions that stopped it, there hadn't ever needed to be.

But it's not only Merkel that makes the difference between the US and germany.
Like the US, germany has a federal political System. So all measures had to be implemented on the state (Bundesl√§nder) level. So all state leaders, no matter what Party they belonged to (we have more than two) held phone conferences and implemented those measures.
Another huge difference to the US is, that people in germany have trust in their politicans and in science. Our education is science based and our leaders asked our scientists for advice before making their decisions. This Was communicated transparently and so people hat a lot of confidence in the implemented measures and followed them.

"I must say that I am really annoyed by those who equates Covid-19 with the plague or calls it a new plague. The plague is a disease on its own, not some kind of phenomena (like a pandemic). The plague, and especially the Black death somewhere between 30 - 60% of the European population. It is estimated to have decreased the world population from ca. 475 million to ca. 375 million. That would be as if Covid-19 killed ca. 1,5 billion people (instead of ca. 1 million, as the time of writing). The plague wiped out entire communities, it lead to fundamental changes in how their economy worked, what kind of freedom people had and impacted generations to come. To compare Covid-19 with the plague is to compare a ""mountain"" in Denmark with a mountain in the Himalayas. 

Don't misunderstand me, both circumstances are awful. Nobody should have to die due to society's unwilling to take action or responsibility for its members. But just as we a responsibility to care for people, we also a responsibility to portray our history a fair and responsible way. 

I'm sure both NYT and Johnny is capable of a more precise and fair language than this word-baiting. I think Philip Alcabes has a lot of good points in his editorial in the American Scholar (""Coronavirus: This Is Not a Plague"", April 6, 2020). https://theamericanscholar.org/coronavirus-this-is-not-a-plague/#.X3mlVGj7TSE

The left Democrats are the worst enemy of the United States... Their governor refused to close the economy Trump can't do anything about it if you understand how things work here... Now after so many people contract and died the left put all the blame to Trump... 
If I am not mistaken among the Western countries Trump was the first to ban travel across China.. And you know what the left Democrats called him Xenophobic.... 
Have you seen a so called  peaceful rally... People were gathering uncontrollable while the virus still spreading nobody care... After few months there's Republican rally... All the Fake medias and leftist shout out the red didn't maintain social distancing bla bla bla.... Hypocrites..... 

And this particular Video is a big Lie.... 
I'm Indian American.. Never have a political feelings before but then this time a realised what is happening exactly between the Democrats and republic... I will vote for Trump this time.... 

 This videos is Lie stupid lie... You know what he said Trump was informed by both WHO and Xi Jing ping as early as January..... Ufffffff..... Ufffffff..... As if Trump was the only President warned by Who and China... What about the rest of the world... When Trump imposes travel ban WHO accused him.... You know what WHO at last announces its pandemic at last on 11th March.... It's too late... Meanwhile the Chinese communist Party never ever announce it's contagious and pandemic until late March
.... On January Taiwan find out on their own that it's contagious human to human... When they informed about this to WHO... It was rejected..totally rejected from the WHO.... 

It's so sad to have A Democrats party here in USA...

"This is a video made with a narrative and ideological perspective of anti-trumpness before it was made. It‚Äôs quite bias from the beginning and not impartial. To blame the whole reason why so many Americans had died on ‚Äúincompetence‚Äù (I assume he‚Äôs implying the incompetence of Donald Tump) is absurd and quite frankly very naive, especially for a respectable journalist like I know Johnny to be. To simplify a complicated chain of events in such way is quite insulting and disrespectful to the watcher. 

Surprised to not hear the positive things that the president had done. For example, how Trump banned travel to and from China very quickly. I think what Johnny fails to highlight is the fact the the USA is one of the only countries that doesn‚Äôt have a free public healthcare system AND is not necessarily equipped to deal with pandemics, rather it is a system that aims to make money.

"The virus outbreak began in China and Italy near labs doing coronavirus gain-of-function experiments, at the same time.  Doctors in Italy were seeing cases back in November.  It seems a furin cleavage sequence was added on a backbone of BatRaTG-13 from aa614 to aa1133, with the Italian insert mutating at the 614 insertion point from a d to a g.  BatRaTG-13 is a lab sample at Wuhan taking in 2013, and the wild virus has mutated.  Other than the furin sequence and mutation in the Italian strain, it is a 100% match to the lab sample, not the wild virus.
Trump approved the gain-of-function that Obama had stopped.  Were did the bas virus come from though?
Vaping related lung illness matched CoViD-19 pathology, and THC lowers immune function.  The virus was found in sewage samples from March 2019 around the world.  I suspect a neutered for low transmissibility and used to study pathogenic code.  I suspect this as the virus appears to have inserts from Measles, Mumps, SARS, MERS, HIV-1, cobra neurotoxin/rabbis, and some potentially computationally derived sections.  For this to happen naturally is not plausible as SARS isn't in nature any more, and HIV-1 inserts couldn't naturally happen.  All the matches are to lab strains, not natural ones.
PS: If Trump's goal was to maximize CoViD-19 deaths, then his actions make sense.  Establishment democrats can't see such realities, defending malice as accidental.  Trump knew the truth about the virus and said he wanted people to gather in churches.  He didn't misspeak.  Removing the uteruses of refugees in US concentration camps, wasn't accidental.",Abram Carroll,2020-10-03T21:16:50Z

"Trump and his supports happened. They not only can't understand what pandemic is, then chose to drag it out by not changing their life style.

It's a pandemic for god's sake. Any other misconceptions and lies are just based on their ignorance and political rhetoric. This could have been prevented but people in leader position had no plan, couldn't suppress their ego and follow previous administrations' plans, and made decisions based on how it would impact their popularity (economy and image). 

The surprising thing is people tend to be smarter when their loved ones die and they can't even visit them on their dying bed. These are all facts. This administration keeps creating problems of their own making and they blame everyone except their own inability to lead.",teetee tee,2020-10-03T15:04:11Z

The left Democrats are the worst enemy of the United States... Their governor refused to close the economy Trump can't do anything about it if you understand how things work here... Now after so many people contract and died the left put all the blame to Trump... 
If I am not mistaken among the Western countries Trump was the first to ban travel across China.. And you know what the left Democrats called him Xenophobic.... 
Have you seen a so called  peaceful rally... People were gathering uncontrollable while the virus still spreading nobody care... After few months there's Republican rally... All the Fake medias and leftist shout out the red didn't maintain social distancing bla bla bla.... Hypocrites..... 

And this particular Video is a big Lie.... 
I'm Indian American.. Never have a political feelings before but then this time a realised what is happening exactly between the Democrats and republic... I will vote for Trump this time.... 

 This videos is Lie stupid lie... You know what he said Trump was informed by both WHO and Xi Jing ping as early as January..... Ufffffff..... Ufffffff..... As if Trump was the only President warned by Who and China... What about the rest of the world... When Trump imposes travel ban WHO accused him.... You know what WHO at last announces its pandemic at last on 11th March.... It's too late... Meanwhile the Chinese communist Party never ever announce it's contagious and pandemic until late March
.... On January Taiwan find out on their own that it's contagious human to human... When they informed about this to WHO... It was rejected..totally rejected from the WHO.... 

It's so sad to have A Democrats party here in USA...

No one should worry about Covid19

2. Just like the Flu
3. Will Disappear

5. Bleach & Light Curable
6. No need to wear mask
7. Curable with Hydroxychloroquine
8. Under Control
9. Numbers are low
10. Ploy by the other party
11. Affects virtually no one
12. Slow down testing\
13. It will magically disappear once it warms up. 
14. It is now gone we have defeated the virus.
15. It is what it is.
16. We will crush the virus. 
17. Testing causes people to have the virus.

Trump and his minion, they brought it on themselves by downplaying the severity of it from the beginning, the lack of country wide testing, telling and making fun of people who are obeying the virus protocols and wearing masks. The lack of a national response and in eliminating the national pandemic response office. He could have at least reopened it when the Virus arrived.

"Here‚Äôs what happened: Comparing stats between countries in this way is a stupid thing to do. Do you know the percentage of tests done to record a confirmed case? The US has one of the highest in the world so more cases are going to be confirmed. In the UK we made mistakes with the death count because some deaths were assumed to be due to COVID19 but never tested and confirmed. Each country will vary wildly because of this and the true figures are extremely difficult or impossible to know. 

Secondly, lockdown in a globalised first world country like America or Germany etc doesn‚Äôt eradicate a virus. The only job of lockdown is to prevent the overwhelming of hospitals. You must let the virus run it‚Äôs course whilst working on more effective treatments (which are readily available) and a vaccine. Measures have been taken in more thorough disinfecting and masks (although the effectiveness on the latter isn‚Äôt clear) and that‚Äôs the best you can do. 

Lockdown also kills people in different ways. Cancer patients who don‚Äôt get screened and treated in time. Neo-natal deaths. Lower income families who lose income and cannot afford treatments for other ailments. The list goes on. Lockdown isn‚Äôt always worth it. 

And lastly, Why haven‚Äôt you done a piece on how the real party that bungled this is China? Hmm? Where are your brave reporters on this one? China didn‚Äôt alert the world, Taiwan tried to warn the WHO but they ignored them because they are under the influence of China.

And now Trump has it. He has done nothing in the ways of the virus. Ugh.,Luna,2020-10-02T23:34:42Z
"When this is over, you should do a program on how many American people died because lack of relief money meant they couldn't spare the money for a test ($200), let alone the costs of paying for hospital care.  You should also be upfront about what those costs are. Countries with a universal health-care did better *for that reason*. People sought help early because they knew it was available to them.

You should also show that such 'playbooks' were available to every country in the world, not because of George Bush but because of the WHO and the work of epidemiologists around the world responding to the earlier Mers and Sars and Ebola epidemics.  Be honest about China. It reported to the WHO on January 3rd.  Trump was still doing nothing In March.  
.
This isn't all about America, or about America-China relations. It's a GLOBAL pandemic. You should report the world response and how Trump had months in which to act. Other nations were implementing the WHO pandemic response plans by the second week of January. There's no excuse for continuing to ignore the world-best responses and ignoring the fact that Trump's hostility to the WHO took America out of the world-wide co-operative effort overseen by the WHO and called 'Solidarity'.  It is from that international effort that the best scientific studies, and the vaccines emerged, save Russia's very dubious vaccine, claimed as the 'first'. 
.
And epidemiologists weren't blind at all. We were following the virus' movement across the wold, watching in horror as first Europe, then America seemed to think it 'couldn't happen here' and neglected the first and most important response - shut the country of from ALL incoming arrivals, and put returning nationals in quarantine at point of entry.
.
 Doctors didn't need 'tests' while numbers were low because they had the list of symptoms by early January and the best reacted accordingly. If the close-off were done early, tracking contacts and applying stay-home was easy and hospitals could manage.  Bush's playbook wasn't part of their response at all, though Obama's might have been. 
.
Defining only Europe as your 'peers' is arbitrary in this context. America's myths of itself as first and exceptional, with only Europe as 'peers' were a very large part of why it failed. Universal health care, an unpoliticised response to medical information, and a government with an ethos of service to the people and who provided steady and sufficient income-support were the ones who did best.  America failed because it's ruling political party cared more for politics and money than for the people.",Di O'Donovan,2020-10-02T23:33:58Z

But the reality is far too many of us can't be bothered to even make a minimal effort to save the life of their neighbor by the simple act of wearing a mask and our leaders are encouraging this outrageous lack of respect for other's lives and that is what I find disturbing about living here.",Mitch Besser,2020-10-05T06:57:21Z

"While I was in Korea when the coronavirus hit hard, information was instantly at the tips of your fingers. Not too long after, contract tracing apps were built and released to show the routes a confirmed patient had taken. At a hotspot of a recently confirmed case, your phone will constantly have emergency alerts updating about which areas have been sanitised, etc. Many other countries were not as well managed and well informed as Korea. Another country that managed best is Taiwan too. 

The issue of lockdown is also arguable because in Daegu (one of the first hardest hit city outside China) did not forcefully lock the city down. There was no legal prohibition against leaving the city or entering the city but people took it upon themselves to stay in by taking up the advice of the government. The streets were mostly empty. Cafes and shops were all closed or opened only a very limited time. While there were people asking to shut the city down, their government did not take the extreme measure yet it was manageable because people were willingly staying in and distancing themselves without being forced to. 

A man like Trump is exactly what he presented himself to be. In fact it‚Äôs the most genuine thing he‚Äôs ever said... he‚Äôs a businessman and his only interest is really just where the money is (for himself). Employers (top management) are only concerned about their wealth more than the health of individual employees. Trump was constantly like that... if the US votes for him again... more lives will be lost in his hands.",rs.k,2020-10-02T17:54:14Z

"Why no mention of the travel ban in January? Why no mention of the mixed data coming from WHO And the CDC? Masks, no masks, masks if your sick, masks don't work, then masks all the time. Why no mention of the millions of tests that were produced very quickly that ended up being unusable because they were faulty? Why no mention of the difficulty in getting PPE because of where we buy PPE? American made had all been moved to China and we were unable to get what we needed? Why no mention of what WAS done, making it look as if the President was operating on his own knowledge. He had lead scientists advising him on what to do and it changed almost every day. Did you not watch the daily briefings? Those are the experts, shouldn't the WHO, the CDC & Dr Fauci be the ones responsible for the response? 
And if you know the way the govt works, then you'd know that the president doesn't have the authority to shut down an entire nation, unless he declared Directive 51 taking away all authority from every government official. The Governors had access to all the information the President did. How they chose to respond in their start was up to them. The president left all the power where it was supposed to be, in the individual states. 
I fail to understand how ALL blame can be placed on 1 imperfect businessman, instead of placing it on the scientists and doctors who were advising the entire world. Do you not recall that the WHO was claiming there was no human to human transmission around the same time the president enacted the travel ban? 
Why don't you put up an accurate time line with ALL the facts and actions this country did, rather than one that omits what was done in response to the Pandemic.

John Hopkins Virus Tracker and CDC Data charts show clearly that the virus peaked in April and by June covid deaths were down to almost Feb levels. The CDC showed .004 by June 30th. After that, we got 'case-demic' - the mainstream media misleading and stirring up panic when testing gave many false positives and deaths were almost a rounding error. Why? What was the purpose in locking down everyone, masking everyone over the summer when most countries were opening up? Could it have anything to do with those who benefit from pushing a 'vaccine?' Fauci sent millions to Wuhan for risky CV research in 2015-2017. Check out the Newsweek article. That was a big red flag. And there's much more.

"The US population is an estimated 350 million people, the EU has nearly an additional 150 million people.   If both those lines are number of infected per 1 million population this scale is already out of context. Because the US pool of per 1 million people is 1/3 smaller than the EU pool so you would have more infected people at the same or similar infection rate giving these graphs.   Also any testing in March-April is highly suspect because as far as I know solid testing was not accessible until July and only NOW in my area are hospitals able to do bulk testing at testing centers (I know I work at a Hospital) They did have testing centers setup in late July I think but they had to have a Rx and the person needed to show symptoms.  Many of those cases are also probable cases, but not confirmed.  I have no idea if the EU did the same thing.",Allan,2020-10-02T11:19:40Z

"You have a failed understanding of math. The ratio of infections to population is most important, if you compared the US' cases to a small country like how you're saying the small country would look great on a graph even if 90% of their population was infected for example but in reality that's really bad. So, a graph of ""total cases"" is relatively useless.",Professor Pepper,2020-10-02T11:44:32Z
"@Professor Pepper I have been considering that possibility, but its not a math problem its  scope problem.   I'm not sure I'm wrong on how this data is interrupted yet, because if its 50 people infected per 1,000,000 people then that would mean that the EU had more infections than the US, but less per capita...But if that's the case why not just use a per capita percentage.",Allan,2020-10-02T12:04:29Z
"Allan If EU ended up having more infections at a given time than the US that would make sense because there are more people to spread those infections. Likewise, for a small population there‚Äôs less people to spread it and less people to even get infected. It‚Äôs a matter of accepting this as a trend that is universally true for comparing any size populations. Extreme comparisons and close ones.

Per capita percentage is the same thing as the graph used. Plotting infections relative to the size of the population is the only fair way to compare different regions‚Äô conditions.",Professor Pepper,2020-10-02T18:16:34Z

"@Mikey Raymond  NYT did many things wrongs with this piece by leaving out facts.  I'll give you one; at 7:26 ""there was some hope we coulda  actually eliminated it (rona) in early January."" It goes on to say ""our leaders"" were focused on other things and glossed over it with the Grammys, Kobe's death, ect. 

Dec. 18,2019  to Feb. 5, 2020, was the bogus impeachment that was brought up against Trump by the Dems. At 7:45 was a great time for NYT to say a few words about the Dems personal hatred towards Trump that caused the impeachment and wasted crucial time, but they didn't. Instead, NYT simply played a clip of Trump, ""I did nothing wrong"" implying he did nothing wrong as a whole in his response to the virus as he's holding up the newspaper reading, ""Trump acquitted""  and moved on to the next segment. I'm pointing this piece specifically because, yes, January was a very crucial time, but the Democrats hold significant responsibility and the NYT failed to mention any of this.

There are many more pieces within this where I can break it down for you, but I feel it would be a waste of my time.  Hopefully, you'll take the time to rewatch this and notice the rhetoric NYT is using.

How do we get around the politics and do what's right for the population?

2. From CDC, only 6% of cases don't show additional causes of death such as heart disease, diabetes, etc. Statistically covid is generally okay for a healthy population and the US population lags the rest of the world on eating habits and exercise.

While I have no problem with the points made in this video, a more objective stance by the vlogger would have taken a broader perspective, that this is a world-wide problem of compliance with the simple facts of how to stop the virus.

"I was disappointed in this video, it had glaring holes. The response to the failures of bureaucracy was that Trump should have corrected that, and taken it as seriously as the border wall. A question to ask is, what would have happened without those bureaucratic failures, with our incompetent president? What would have happened if we had good tests fast, with or without lockdowns and other measures, which Trump failed to do? From what I've read, the CDC created a faulty test, and FDA made it literally impossible for others to create and get approval for a test. This was triggered by the rules of an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), it was set up for failure. We were literally selling materials for tests to Europe. Ideally it would have been set up to create a good test in days without the need for a president to take part at all. Clearly it would have been vastly better of we had a competent president, and sure, he could have reversed what happened, but the system that may have been improved by the previous two presidents still had fundamental failures or inadequacies. Those inadequacies may have caused our numbers to be far higher than they would have been. I know enough from having read that, but what I know is so very little, and I was hoping to get more info about that. These have systemic problems that we should not be ignoring and correct, that are institutional failures that are deeper than who's in office.

He is a poor excise for a president. I saw without and reservations all of the traits that make Trump an incompetent and incapable leader. When he is not given total control over everyone and everything, his insecurities get the best of him, and he literally breaks down and implodes.

Americans can actually question the authority (many societies cannot do that without consequences), so Americans can do whatever they want without retaliation from the government (AND THAT'S A GOOD THING, IN MY OPINION).

So weather Trump is a good or bad president, it all boils down to people's values. If you want an authoritarian president, Trump is a bad president. If you want a freedom-loving president, Trump is a relatively good president.",Cristian Talero,2020-10-02T19:14:38Z

Well done Johnny!!,Sergio Malatesta,2020-10-01T09:09:21Z
India had imposed one of the early lockdowns. We had one of the lowest infections among major countries. But we couldn't defeat the virus and the economic backlash meant we needed to open the country. And now the cases are skyrocketing.,Anmol Dixit,2020-10-01T09:07:11Z
"This should more accurately be titled: ""how the Trump administration bungled the handling of this Covid 19 epidemic through dishonest to keep the stock market high and enable his re-election and how it CONTINUES UNREPENTANTLY, AND WITHOUT ANY MORAL QUALMS to bungle it as we speak with super spreader rallies, discouraging of mask-wearing, lies, etc.""",Mi M,2020-10-01T09:03:25Z
NYT is back at making sure Biden win,Jimmy Neutron,2020-10-01T09:02:36Z
"Trump should have gotten funding for what Pelosi suggested initially: testing, testing, testing, then contact tracing and more testing, testing and testing, so we could then quarantine the infected persons and limit the spread of Covid 19 in FEBRUARY 2020. That would have required a lot of workers. However, the alternative after Trump failed to allow the standard epidemiological testing, contact tracing, and quarantining, when that was negligently NOT done by Trump, became lockdowns.

After his initial failures, Trump incompetently then actually had the dishonest audacity to keep lying and opposed the lockdowns that his misconduct and lies, negligently, made necessary.",Mi M,2020-10-01T09:00:26Z
"Germany, Taiwan, etc., all demonstrate how few Americans could have died, if America had a competent, honest, national leader like they have had.",Mi M,2020-10-01T08:55:57Z
"The most sad thing is that, even after the competent governors of California and New York showed what had to be done, states like Florida have not forgotten completely the appropriate responses to this COVID-19 and are reopening while their infections are on the rise and while they have NOT reached anywhere near herd immunity. Thus, like the dog that cannot comprehend that a fan blade will hurt him, who keeps sticking his nose in the fan, the foolish governor of Florida is again repeating the same dumb mistakes yet again, because he is a Trump cultist. 

I predict that more Floridians will die due to his mistakes. I wish that we could change the laws, so that governors can be sued like doctors for malpractice, because governors have much greater powers than doctors to cause unnecessary deaths due to negligence.",Mi M,2020-10-01T08:52:38Z
"One final comment, any suggestion that any place in the US is getting close to herd immunity is absurd. With very contagious viruses, like measles, herd immunity is not reached until 90%+ of the population gets vaccinated or is infected and recovers. Long-term carriers may exist, as with this Covid-19, that manage, unintentionally to transmit this virus to distant pockets of Americans that were isolated and not immune, e.g., the homeless or rural residents, even if most Americans some, distant year in the future, reach herd immunity.

Measels has an R0 that varies depending on conditions but may be 12+. See https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(17)30307-9/fulltext. This virus may also have very high R0 if conditions exist in a county like Trump's huge, maskless, close-packed rallies or Florida's foolish reopening of bars (etc.) without mask or other requirements or other restrictions.

I am starting to be reminded of a very dumb dog that I once knew with a fan whose wire protective cage had come off. The dog kept putting his nose near the fan and getting his nose hit by the fan blade and crying in pain every so often, because he could not absorb the idea that the fan would hurt him. 

Similarly, Trump's cultists, like the Florida fools, repeatedly ignore the fact that NO we do not have herd immunity anywhere in the USA and YES, this virus remains very, very highly transmissible if you do not wear masks and take precautions such as social distancing and quarantining of infected individuals. Thus, you, Trump cultists, will get your noses hit again and again by the COVID 19 virus each time, because you cannot comprehend reality, apparently. The R0 of this virus in areas filled with Trump's foolish cultists who do not take precautions probably approaches that of measles, so it will take many, many years to reach ""herd immunity.""",Mi M,2020-10-01T08:47:32Z
"I guarantee that greedy health insurers, if freed by Judge Barrett from the restrictions in the ACA as planned by Trump and the Republicans, will use AI to predict which people who will soon get certain diseases and maximize their profits by dropping them from their rolls of insureds. Such software was already created:
See MIT Technology Review:
""In 2015, a research group at Mount Sinai Hospital in New
York was inspired to apply deep learning to the hospital‚Äôs
vast database of patient records. This data set features
hundreds of variables on patients, drawn from their test
results, doctor visits, and so on. The resulting program,
which the researchers named Deep Patient, was trained
using data from about 700,000 individuals, and when
tested on new records, it proved incredibly good at
predicting disease. ‚Ä¶ Deep
Patient had discovered patterns hidden in the hospital data
that seemed to indicate when people were on the way to a
wide range of ailments, including cancer of the liver.""

See https://www.technologyreview.com/2017/04/11/5113/the-dark-secret-at-the-heart-of-ai/. That is the evil Republicans' central plan. Republicans want to maximize the profits of the ultra-rich, who own them, by allowing them to destroy the Affordable Care Act's protections to Americans with pre-existing conditions. (Trump's executive order claiming to bar insurers from rejecting people with pre-existing conditions is patently illegal and unenforceable, as he knows, because he is only using that order to deceive Americans while he destroys their real protections in the Affordable Care Act.) 

They want to insure only those, healthiest Americans whose medical expenses will be so minor that the premiums that they charge them will be pure profit. It is unlikely that any one of you readers of this comment are among those elite Americans.  If you think you are, chances are that your doctor may have some surprise information for you to dissuade you from your mistaken belief.",Mi M,2020-10-01T08:47:11Z
"Trumpets will also see the role of BLM protests in increasing the cases. Funny the timeline of the 2 nd spike and the protest(aka VIOLENT riots and looting) coincides. I wonder what's the story behind that. No need to worry and think about that , we can always blame trump for everything.",Primal Power,2020-10-01T14:26:31Z
"If you compare the U.S/U.K with H.K/Japan/SK you can tell in Asian countries it's because the citizens are well-informed and take the advice of the government. While in the U.S/U.K, they have people calling Covid-19 a hoax and not listening to the advice of their government. There's also a misinformation campaign happening in the U.S and possibly the U.K. If you browse the internet long enough, you'll encounter some monkey that states Covid-19 is a government hoax that is being used to distract the public while the government creates some sort of slave state to control the populace.",James Yuen,2020-10-02T06:47:25Z

Maybe we were naive, maybe we just didn't understand the odd priorities of this president. But, there is one thing I would point out about the apparent pandemic failure in New York (and of course other locations around the country). All of us, and more notably state and local governments, especially in major cities, never in a million years thought that the federal government, of which the president became the calculating mouthpiece, would feed us anything but information that would warn us, give us guidelines to protect ourselves, and ultimately save American lives from a dangerous disease. We never believed our government at the highest levels would serve us anything, EXCEPT good information. There is no question in my mind, that those early ""downplay"" pressers by the president, caused citizens and government officials all over the country to relax as well.

"Reading the comments section and seeing the amount of misinformation and misconceptions people are determined to cling to against evidence is depressing. It appears the penchant for paranoia and conspiracy theories is still more attractive to many over attempting to understand the actual scientific foundations and principles. Factors that contribute to this situation has probably been the influence of religious groups in undermining scientific endeavours and scientific literacy as well as the tendency for some Americans to prioritise individual liberty over wider societal well being. Ironically preserving the economy was one of the reasons put forth for reopening so quickly when the economic fallout from the high level of cases and deaths is going to have a significant long term economic impact due to medical debt, homelessness and job insecurity as a result of illness or the loss of a family member (let alone the humanitarian impact of lost life). At a time when American citizens need to be working together to get through this they are instead expending energy fighting with each other and it is sad. I wonder how the people who insist COVID-19 is a hoax think that the whole world somehow collaborated to pull this off and to what end? (as in a rational explanation not some way out idea of micro chipping everyone when cell phones can serve that purpose already).

"The Republicans are all corrupt and will not act in the US Senate. The orange blubber ball has figured out that he will lose a fair election, so he is trying to prevent one by every means possible: since the COVID 19 pandemic is so widespread due to his selfish, immoral decisions to deceive the American people by telling them that this was like the flu and would go away magically, when the Woodward interviews with the orange blubber ball show he (the Trump blubber ball) knew better, he has sabotaged the mail which many Americans want to use to vote to avoid the risk of catching COVID 19. 

What can we expect from someone who apparently has the caring for others of a psychopath: Trump.
McConnell also has the morals of a brain-addled, diseased snake and I predict that he and his Republicans will receive HUGE bribes from the health insurance industry if they manage to get Judge Barrett elected to the US Supreme court to destroy the Affordable Care Act: that will enable the Republicans to strike down the prohibitions preventing health insurers from dropping the majority of Americans from their health insurance.

Most Americans do not realize that they have pre-existing conditions that would render them uninsurable by the greedy, private health insurance but for the ACA prohibitions. See https://www.diabetes.org/diabetes-risk/prevention/high-blood-pressure; and https://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Resources/Forms-Reports-and-Other-Resources/preexisting

Trust me, you may have undiagnosed diabetes or high blood pressure or some other undiagnosed pre-existing condition: a condition that you already had when you get health care each year. If so, the health insurers will swiftly have you diagnosed with those conditions and drop you as their insured once Judge Barrett kills the Affordable Care Act for them. This has been agreed upon and is a done deal. 

NY is investigating the Trumps for tax fraud. The Mueller Report implied that there was collusion but merely not a conspiracy. The charges against his former attorney, Mr. Cohen, referenced Mr. Trump as a co-conspirator for election finance fraud. Thus, if he loses, Trump knows that he will likely face criminal charges and spend the rest of his days in an orange jumpsuit in a small room, while the secret service presumably will be in the jail to prevent prisoners from taking out each of his (Trump's) evil acts on his rear end.

"Oh, it's really quite simple how it was bungled.   You see the Democrats had a plan to destroy Trump's economy and they with the help of China unleashed a plague on the world in an attempt to put it on Trump and try to make it look like it was his fault.  To do this they had to lie about the numbers.  Trump had to be guilty for a lot of death to get the public to turn against him.  Numbers had to fudged to get there.  All the death in the USA was primarily because of a policy to put older, infected patients in retirement homes with other high-risk individuals.  That was a policy the CDC did not endorse, that policy was taken up by the Democrats only and only in their states.  The actual death count is much much lower.  you will notice hardly anyone died of anything else this year.  only COVID.    no car wrecks, no heart attacks, or coronary, no drug overdoses, We did have plenty of shootings, those are clearly all Trump's fault though because the left says so.   So America, you just went through yet another Big time scam pulled over on you by the people who are the elites and own and run everything and their minions in the mainstream media.   Why, because they have an interest in returning the world to the total control status of the old monarchy system.  Except now, it's a technocracy.  You will live in poverty while they live in comfort.   It's time to remove the power the media outlets have to report anything.  They are nothing but a social control construct the origins of which can be seen in Hitler's Germany with Joseph Goebbels as a propaganda minister.  They use all the MSM as an echo chamber, they use the blue check marks and influencers to echo chamber, they use fact-checkers as an echo chamber to drive narrative.

Because hospitals and clinics are all separately governed there is great difficulty in developing or executing a national plan.

"15:52 ""Level Of Shutdown""?? Sweden barely shut down at all; they didn't mandate masks in most circumstances and their social distancing requirements were more relaxed than those in many U.S. states, but their death rate was very similar to that of the USA, UK, Spain or France and it has since declined to almost zero. Most experts in Sweden agree that it is close to herd immunity. Meanwhile, the countries with the most draconian shutdowns like Spain are still hiding from this virus, hoping it will just go away and are re-imposing lockdows against a virus they thought they had defeated. Trying to limit exposure of the general population to a virus this contagious is a fool's errand; the population would have to hide indefinitely (or until a vaccine can be trusted) to keep  the spread contained while the deaths, bankruptcies and other tragedies from the resulting economic depression would continue to mount. In areas with cramped, poorly isolated multifamily housing, locking people in their homes can actually increase the transmission of a virus and the viral load to which those people are exposed. The aim from the start should have been to keep the viral load of each exposure low enough to prevent serious illness. In August, the CDC briefly conceded that airborne transmission of COVID-19 in tight, poorly ventilated spaces was a significant factor in its spread (explaining the much higher rates in areas dependent on mass transit), but it soon retracted that statement under pressure from the WHO. Eventually, I suspect that they will again face up to this reality. There should have been more focus, from both sides of the political spectrum, on indoor air quality and the means of improving it. It's a scandal that buses and subway cars are still operating with all the windows closed after 9 months of this. There should also have been an intensive effort, starting in January, to verify air purification systems for spaces that can't economically be vented to the outdoors. Shutdowns and the police-state measures needed to enforce them should have been the last resort, not the first.",PC No,2020-09-30T18:16:05Z

"Not from Covid dear Times:
*Wrong Corona death numbers worldwide*

1.
It was decided very early on that one absolutely had to treat a respiratory viral disease, although there is no effective treatment for respiratory infections.

Covid patients have therefore often died from the harmful effects of treatment. Every second intensive care patient. Didn't die from the virus but from the treatment. Extremely early, very intensive positive pressure ventilation took place.
Other Covid patients who were not ventilated did not die, as numerous doctors report.

2.
Drug cocktails:

Lots of reserve antibiotics that have massive side effects.
These antiviral drug cocktails are usually fatal, especially for older people with a low tolerance to drugs and who have already received 5 to 10 drugs as long-term medication.

3.
The drugs used, i.e. antiviral drugs such as remdesivir or hydroxychloroquine and reserve antibiotics, are not evidence-based effective.

4. PCR test

Only knows a snippet of RNA on the mucous membrane of a person. The test is not suitable for detecting an infection or disease. Nor is it suitable for diagnostics, as the inventor of the PCR test himself admitted.

5.
Someone who 30 days before his death, e.g. who had a positive Covid test through an accident is considered a Covid dead (WHO guideline).

6th
People without a positive test were also counted as Covid deaths. Alone on visual inspection. However, symptoms also correspond to influenza.

7th
People who tested positive for corona antibodies and died of something else are considered Covid dead. Without ever having Covid.

8th.
Most of the Covid deaths in England (study) did not die of Covid, but rather because they were deported from clinics to nursing homes in poor condition to get the beds free. In the nursing homes they died under controlled neglect. Publication from the British Medical Journal.

9.
Of the 9,000 Covid deaths in Germany, hardly any really died of Covid. From the 250 autopsies carried out by Professor P√ºschel it can be seen that only very, very few patients really died significantly of Covid.

10.
Covid negative patients were deliberately used for financial reasons
Covid infected and intubated.
With fatal consequences.
According to Medicare, hospitals receive US $ 13,000 for a Covid patient and US $ 39,000 for intubation
(Elmhurst Hospital in New York).

11.
Then there is the WHO and those with it
interwoven pharmaceutical industry.
According to intelligence information on database italia in the report by investigative journalist Nicola Bizzi, the WHO has bribed politicians to carry out a lockdown.
Panic caused by wrong numbers should urge everyone to get vaccinated.
Fraud is the faulty one here
PCR TEST.
With the lucrative vaccination business, Pharma wants to make up for the decline in sales of the last 20 years.
(Arte: profiteers of fear).

I roll my eyes every time somebody compares this to the plague. The actual plague killed a third of the entire world population. This thing has a mortality rate of less than one percent. Serological studies suggest it to be more in the range of the seasonal flu.

And yet we are not adjusting our response according to the new information we have.

Concepts, ideas and opinions can be a good thing and a bad thing. They can give you a goal, sometimes a worthy one to strive toward and a bad thing when they become obsessions.

It‚Äôs not enough to ‚Äòthink‚Äô you are right, you have to KNOW you are right and that means proof.

So make your opinions informed ones, not a second-hand opinions.


A WORD ON PANDEMICS

Hey you people, this is not our first rodeo.

Goto this web site below to discover WHERE this pandemic fits into the World pandemic History and give yourself a sense of where, in history, this pandemic belongs instead of today‚Äôs hysterical doomsday predictions.

After reading this site and seeing just ‚Äòwhere‚Äô this pandemic belongs, you will begin to wonder what all the ‚Äòfuss‚Äô is about.

They are turning us into a world of agoraphobics.
(ag¬∑o¬∑ra¬∑pho¬∑bic - noun - a person with an extreme or irrational fear of entering open or crowded places, of leaving their own home, or of being in places from which escape is difficult.)

I long for the good old days like the ones a couple of years ago.
I miss my freedoms of being able to go where I want when I want and how I want. Places like shopping malls, walks in the nature parks with the blue skies and the beautiful vivid shades of green, bingo, the Legion, sports events, picnics with loved ones, bowling, walking through a crowd like bumper cars. You get the idea.
Freedom without mass restrictions instead of ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù with restrictions.

Now that does not sound like any kind of ‚Äòfreedom‚Äô I have ever learned about, does it to you?
‚ÄúFreedom‚Äù with limited restrictions is not called freedom.
That is the definition of martial law.

Does that mean ‚Äòthey‚Äô have taken our freedom away from us without a fight?
I wonder?
Is this the silent, sneaky world domination take-over war I have been hearing about?
All wars end. When will this one end, and what will this world be like I wonder?

Conclusion:
There‚Äôs more here than what they are telling us, and it is beginning to sound more like a spamdemic.

Europe is a landmass similar to the USA- each country made its own response. Very different responses. Compare the UK to USA. Our lockdown in Ireland was accompanied by very large numbers of incoming visitors - tourism. Large sporting events went ahead at the start of lockdown.Now our numbers are rising again as lockdowns between counties lift- we are doing cyclical short lockdowns not total lockdowns or total shutdowns of businesses.

One last thing: Number of tests. Your own CDC says on the website, that the US performed 110.4 million tests so far ( 09/28/20 ) while here in Germany for example we did 14.5 million. I did not find the number of tests in all of Europe, but be sure it is far less than in the US. Because we do a lot of testing and have the highest number of residents in Europe. More tests mean more positives.

At the end of the video you mention, that you have surpassed 200.000 deaths in the US due to corona. Here in Europe, we had ( 160.000 ) on 07/28/20 so by now the number should be almost equal.

Then when the shut down ended, Americans calmed down.  The truth is You do not Know modern day Americans and you sure dont know a thing about Virus's. It does not matter who would have been president, the virus would have spread.

https://covid19.who.int/region/euro/country/se

Sweden's mortality rate has been about twice that of an average influenza season, 2800. Their worst influenza season was in 1993 that took 97,000 lives and their current covid deaths of 5800 is no where near that 1.2% death rate.

There are strong associations that the ""sick"" have nutrient deficiencies causing their immune system to not perform optimally.
This study uses W.H.O. data sets from 20 European nations that shows an associationbetween a nation's population with higher levels of vitamin D in serum and lower morbidity ratesof covid-19.

The PCR test was improperly used as there was a financial incentive to have people  diagnosed with covid in hospitals, so some states had false-positives rates as high as 90% as in NY, MA and NV as they amplified the RNA amounts by 30 to 40 times. 

50% to 60% of the populations exposed to covid-19 have no symptoms.
If we test the blood panels of those that tested positive with no symptoms and compare their physiology to that of the sick, then identify and define the differences that result  could be the solution. No country or institution has yet to do this.

  MSMedia has helped too in that process, spread lies and false info, and barley corrected themselves when shown to be false!! Or quietly if they did.  The virus is not as the mainstream narrative would have us believe. 
 
The CDC itself has put out corrected stats.  Figures of deaths due to Covid, rather than just WITH covid are dramatically lower, classified correctly.  Positive test rates grossly over-exaggerated, with 30% false positives, again CDC stats.  
Tests from one source counted numerous times if more than a sample taken (1-nose 2nd-mouth etc), and on more than once occasion, hugely pushes the numbers up.  Just a few examples of how we've been misled.

"Utter anti-Trump propaganda.  No mention of the Coronavirus Task Force, the Lockdown, the mobilization of Public and Private enterprises to manufacture and distribute PPE, Ventilators, Tests, and Vaccines, the building of emergency hospitals, Hospital Ships and the travel bans.
America is a Union of States. Each State has been affected differently by the Coronavirus Pandemic.  One could compair our States to European Countries. Our system designed so that the States address their own public needs and the Federal Government facilitates the States, rather than impose a one-size-fits-all solution to the entire Union. 

In addition cases do not equal deaths. Countries that conduct a lot of tests detect a lot of cases. Those that do little show little. This epidemic will only end when enough people are exposed and develop an immunity, either through contact or vaccine.  The reality is that the overwhelming majority of infected people recover from the disease and few  even require hospitalization. So a large number of cases that do not require hospitalization is actually a positive step to ending the pandemic.
This report is pure propaganda.",skywalker20877,2020-09-30T13:44:32Z

"The Real Story:
Gates, UNICEF & WHO have already been credibly accused of intentionally sterilizing Kenyan children through the use of a hidden HCG antigen in tetanus vaccines.

In 2014, the Catholic Bishops Conference of Kenya conducted a study on the 5-injection, 2 year  vaccination project performed on female Kenyans aged 14-49, in a South African laboratory. They concluded that ‚Äúall 6 samples tested positive for the HCG antigen.‚Äù

Our worst fears were proven -- that the WHO campaign is NOT about eradicating neonatal tetanus, but is a well-coordinated, forceful population control, mass sterilization exercise using a proven fertility regulating vaccine,‚Äù said Dr. Ngare, spokesman for the Kenya Catholic Doctors Association. ‚ÄúThis evidence was presented to the Ministry of Health before the third round of immunization, but was ignored.‚Äù Bill Gates stated his interest in ‚Äúreducing population growth‚Äù by means of vaccinations.

"Interesting video. The charts and everything is good but you did not give a more rounded picture. There is blame at every level but to not say the overwhelming majority of deaths have been the elderly and those with pre existing underlying issues is an misrepresentation of how this virus impacted America. To not state that of the thousands of deaths COVID-19 was NOT the sole cause paints an incomplete picture. Also reporting of cases/deaths are vastly inaccurate. You didn‚Äôt mention the medical ships built for the sick that were never used because the onslaught of affected people never happened. There is less than 1% of the population affected but if you watch the media it seems like that number should be 15-20%. And the media is still pushing out the high number of cases but not showing that death rates have dropped significantly. The predictions have been way off...listening to the experts. The numbers seem to show this being a bad flu. We quarantine the sick, not the healthy. Data is not showing that a major lockdown would have significantly changed the death rates...excluding the states where infected were sent to nursing homes. I think leaving the decision to the states whether or not to lockdown was good. America is different from all other countries because of the idea of personal freedom built into its fabric. One role of leadership is to not overreact.",Nomenclature,2020-09-30T12:40:56Z

"One word...Ferguson.  Inept, wrong, overestimating Ferguson.  The imperial model was based on minimal evidence that was extrapolated and magnified to give a hugely incorrect data set.  It horrified epidemiologists at Oxford and other institutions to see the world use this one model as the basis of all their policies.  Lockdowns ensued everywhere (no scientific basis) but a few lucky states and countries.  The results have been pure devastation, not from a virus, but perpetrated by governments.  Suicides, poverty, illness, death.....all cause mortality rising far more than the virus could account for.  Fauci has championed this model from the beginning and although it has been roundly debunked now he continues this doomsday rhetoric.  Only Florida and South Dakota are enjoying life and liberty right now.  Florida‚Äôs governor brought ALL the great minds in this debate to the table rather than a darling few.  He convened them from around the world and reached the scientific based conclusion that these measures are not in fact changing the trajectory of the virus, therefore he dissolved those draconian policies.  These policies are much like a drug with a laundry list of side effects that includes death, but has zero efficacy against the disease for which you are taking it.  People must understand that Sweden is not the experiment....it is the control group....lockdown is the unprecedented intervention.

Nota Bene we in the UK do pay for our Healthcare by deductions from pay on a sliding scale called National Insurance.  The UK is also a very small country compared to the USA. When we were locked down I contracted Covid-19 and was very ill; our healthcare system completely shut down and GPs would only speak to you by phone or tell you to go to Accident & Emergency who also didn't want to see you; they sent me home without telling me I had critically high blood pressure and prescribed steriods that made the chest pain so much worse.  Another random GP i spoke to a week later said my recorded blood pressure from the hospital visit was so high I could have had a stroke and died.  It was a ridiculous situation; chaotic and all the doctors were too scared to see you.  Some 6 mths later i am still suffering post viral issues....basically any health care system would fail in a Pandemic.

Im actually a microbiologist who performs COVID tests and I know for a fact that we, both locally and nationally, have been aggressively expanding our testing for this disease continuously since at least March. I also know the shady stuff that goes on on the inside. Testing people who could not possibly have been killed by the disease, testing unvalidated sample types and reporting those as legitimate results, etc. The number of cases we have identified could easily be attributed to the massive amount of testing we have done but I can guarantee that there's a percentage of those reported cases that are not accurate.",Lee Lu,2020-09-30T17:06:18Z
Yep Victoria Australia messed up with a breakdown in the protective processes and our second hit with 70 cases/day - BUT then we shut down and introduced mandatory masks and now 6 weeks later we are down to 5-10 cases/day and now looking at being able to SAFELY send our kids to school and SLOWLY and METHODICALLY open up - the rest of Australia did not have the same issue when they reopened. In Australia COVID-19 has been treated as a humanitarian/health issue with a clear consistent message as per the WHO guidelines. We also have the benefit of a generally greater science literacy and understanding the rationale behind the policies and strategies implemented with most (not all of course) appreciating that it will take a united effort and short term sacrifice for the greater good. The government also worked at maintaining the economic infrastructure so that businesses and work could hopefully resume as efficiently as possible.

"What a load of Anti Trump propaganda. The socialist governments inflate the deaths from the Chinese Corona 19 Virus to further their Fabian Socialist agenda. Sure people die from the virus. Yet, the vast majority of them are the very old or otherwise immune diminished, just as is the case for a bad flue season that comes about once every 10 years. Our politicians are following the advice of the expert bureaucrats instead of representing their electorate and so they follow the socialist creed of rule by the elite. That is, our politicians are the useful idiots of the elite bureaucrats who are committed to Fabian socialism. Look at the replacement of our laws and constitutional protections with autocratic rule that has been imposed upon us. Look at the loss of freedom that we have endured. During the real pandemic of 1918 and 1919, (i.e. the Spanish Flue), 2% of the world's population died as a result of that illness. The real death rate from the Chinese Corona 19 virus and even the reported death rate are orders of magnitude less than that for the Spanish Flu. The real suffering and deaths that have occurred due to the Chinese Corona 19 virus are those who have NOT been treated because of the over reaction to the Chinese Corona 19 virus.

"Besides the government's poor handling of the virus, one thing that I'm certain contributed to the explosion of cases in the US was all the protests, demonstrations and riots following the death of George Floyd. If you look at a graph of covid cases over time, the curve was on a down-trend until late May to early June.
Video of George Floyd rapidly spread throughout the country in late May, and cases begin to steeply increase not long after protests start breaking out around the country.

No other European nation is dealing with civil unrest on a scale a large as America right now. Pretty much no other country on earth is seeing such widespread conflict from within it's own borders, with not only protests for accountability and equality, but protests protesting the coronavirus itself...

3. They are notorious for NOT using air conditioning unless the heat & humidity are brutal, so windows and doors are perpetually open with electric fans circulating the air. 

4. Like Koreans, they immediately began wearing masks under penalty of law. If Trump had tried that in February, he would have been attacked from every direction.

South Koreas has done far more testing per population than we have,
South Korea tracers quickly questioned when & where infected people traveled, what stores they visited, what buses they took, etc,
This information was widely published on line & in newspapers, & anybody who might have crossed paths with an infected person was encourage to quarantine themselves and get tested.
The South Korean citizenry actively cooperated with social distancing & masks.   
They have had about 414  deaths.   Adjusted for population, that would be less than 3,000 death, compared to our 200,000 deaths
The result is that their social & work lives are near normal,  with only a few business shut down, but with ¬¨no general lockdowns or sheltering in place  
New Zealand had zero new cases for month.    Taiwan & Singapore have also done surprisingly well.",Osman Vincent,2020-09-30T09:15:05Z

I don't like Trump but when you omit facts to suit your narrative you lose all credibility with me and millions just like me. You omitted the flight ban back in January where Biden called Trump a Xenophobe for it.  Or Pelosi encouraging people to visit chinatown back in Feburary because Trump is racist.  Or Biden encouraging people to go vote in person at the poles during the height of the pandemic.  Covid - 19 was made a political football and that had a lot to do with the fumbling of this by BOTH SIDES. Leaving people who tested positive in nursing homes had a major impact on the number of deaths.  Not to mention many other things.  This is nothing but blatant propaganda SMFH.,Topaaz Moons,2020-09-30T09:07:27Z

Like the one he used for H1N1.....they held it to 14 k deaths right.... That's great right?
Yeah...  No it isn't.. they did EVERYTHING WRONG ACCORDING TO THE GUY IN CHARGE. ""WE got lucky we did everything wrong if it had been deadly 500k-1.4 million would have died
And you said ""what if  Trump would have done this and that in mid January.....we were focused on the grammies  and the super bowl and kobe bryant"" 
That is so disgustingly biased....this is such propaganda....
Now what was government REALLY REALLY REALLY FOCUSED ON?

With an antibiotic, Vitamin D3 and sublingual zinc given in the first 10 days and 95% bounce back in a day or 2 to 80% the other 20 % we in therapy help them get back....in addition several MD's and RN's took low doses as Prophylactic to prevent 0.....ZERO OF THEM GOT IT...ALMOST HALF THE ONES WHO DIDN'T TAKE IT OR GOT PLACEBO GOT IT. YES IT WAS A STUDY. The outcomes we Don't know.....why you ask...well 2 weeks from conclusion it was shut down by CDC. Why....because it's killing people in high numbers. Yeah that's true in the studies in Europe and S America that gave 5 times the dose given here twice..... TWICE A DAY...DO TEN TIMES THE DOSE. These studies in the medical community have been nicknamed the lonely Funeral studies because if you were in them that's what you got 85% death rate... All other studies going on....2 deaths TOTAL OF OVER 8000 PEOPLE. 
So why? "" To hurt Trump"" NOPE!!

"Part of the problem  was also the time that it hit, at the start of April the noise coming from abroad was its a form of flu and that hive immunity was the way forward, typically flu cases also start to drop off outside winter it was only when Italy started to die did anyone take it more serious, people look at this and think 200,000 dead but no one takes into the account of urban density per mile as well, and in the us the first places to get it was super city‚Äôs compared to Europe ny is like taking two Greater London areas and doubling the population, that is why ny was affected worse.  Put can you imagine what the response would have been if we said everyonee in ny is isolated , no air no train no going out it would be political suicide but you also have to take in the human element in all this,  that is that a large element on the nation thought it was a big conspiracy and refused to wear masks, it‚Äôs just the flu  what if some Yonkers died of it I‚Äôm in the middle of nowhere, or small town of a few hundred/thousand  I have a mortgage to pay I can‚Äôt afford to take time off, Europe‚Äôs just over reacting.   Then it jumped and people started  to get serious long term effects that no one knew before but still a large element still are not raking this serious, it‚Äôs not the winter of 2019-2020 people should be afraid of its this coming winter this is where lockdowns will be inevitable air , car and rail cannot leave the state, you must not socialise at home with distant family and friends this thanksgiving bars and restaurants will have to separate tables and limit entry,  everyone must follow the two metre rule .

Be afraid of the freedoms that are gone forever!   Be terrified of the fact that every differing opinion has been scrubbed from all media.   Be afraid of why this hoax is happening and the wicked agenda that is behind this!   Ask yourself, why is this happening and how is it possible this planned 'scamdemic'  is all you hear day in and day out!   Take some time to teally research the facts about this nefarious control grab,  quit watching the fearporn on nbc, cbs, cnn, fox, msnbc,  etc. and you will see that everything Im saying is correct!

"So we scapegoat one guy? The president? C'mon. No one really knew the extent of the disease. In fact, to be fair, Europe countries count their Covid-19 deaths differently than we do. It's a different metric, and so the numbers are more difficult to compare statistically.

As far as I can tell, Covid-19 is approximately as deadly as the '57 flu season when there wasn't a shutdown. Remember that the initial concern was to not overwhelm the hospitals and access to life-saving equipment, not to wait potentially indefinitely for a cure, which may never come.

And last but not least, there's a economic tradeoff that needs to be factored in. If you destroy enough economic value by shuttering businesses, you exacerbate unemployment and then depression and violence becomes an option. If we look around, we can definitely see the aftermath of wreckage that immediately followed the months of shelter-in-place economic inactivity.",Pappa Flammy Boi,2020-09-30T08:01:28Z

"Epidemiologists - not just Americans - made sure a modern epidemic-response 'playbook' was available to every country in the world by no later than 2017.  Other countries were - obviously - better prepared, because they took the recommendations in those guideline books seriously and *moved fast* from the second week of January. The best-performing countries weren't in Europe. They were in countries where politics and fantasies of cultural superiority and exceptionalism didn't slow or interfere with the messaging from public health experts. In Australia, which closed off all incoming arrivals except for returning nationals by early February, the vast majority of infections which had already arrived by then HAD NOT come with people coming from China, but already in people coming from Europe and America.  But as late as March 17th., Mr. Trump was saying the pandemic was just a hoax invented to bother him, personally and dithered about closing the country off. In fact, he never did it and that's the FIRST step in pandemic response. You isolate the country, then the area first infected, and the individuals who might spread the infection after arriving from elsewhere. Mr. Trump is not quite balanced in his views about this problem. Nor was President Bolsonaro.  The genome sequence shows, too, that the massive outbreak in the US was not due to any direct flight from China. It is a mutation that developed in Europe. It came to the US *from Europe*. The single greatest tragedy is that New York's governor didn't have the authority to shut out all incoming flights, with returning nationals quarantined for 2 weeks at point of entry. That is standard response. As you'll see if you look past Europe to Asia and Australasia.  The world doesn't consist of just America and Europe.  New Zealand is the world's best example.",D Ntodo,2020-09-30T06:51:10Z

- 31 December 2019 they reported the first outbreak, and shared the virus genetic sequence information on 12th January 2020.
- 21-22 January 2020 WHO experts from its China and Western Pacific regional offices conducted a brief field visit to Wuhan. 
- 22nd January 2020 WHO mission to China issued a statement saying that there was evidence of human-to-human transmission in Wuhan but more investigation was needed to understand the full extent of transmission. 

- 28 January 2020 A senior WHO delegation led by the Director-General travelled to Beijing to meet China‚Äôs leadership, learn more about China‚Äôs response, and to offer any technical assistance. While in Beijing, Dr. Tedros agreed with Chinese government leaders that an international team of leading scientists would travel to China on a mission to better understand the context, the overall response, and exchange information and experience.

If you say under exclusively from America governmental agency experts to come, then China never request so.

"This was an excellent look at the ridiculous response in the US. As someone who returned from South Korea to the US amid this pandemic, I cannot overstate how different the response has been. 

I would love to see more journalism and analysis like this, especially on the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic in China. I noticed that Nick Kristof mentioned how irresponsibility Chinese leadership acted early on. I‚Äôm glad he mentioned that and because the context is how the US messed up here, I understand why there was not more said about the situation, but as someone who traveled from Beijing to Seoul just before the crisis hit a fever pitch at the international level, I have been following the response closely. I don‚Äôt think everyone has had the same interest or motivation to look at the early days or follow them as closely as I did at the time. Given Nick Kristof‚Äôs knowledge of Chinese and Johnny Harris‚Äôs excellent visual storytelling, I can‚Äôt think of a pair of people better qualified to examine the timeline of who knew what and when in Wuhan‚Äôs government, Hubei‚Äôs government, in Beijing, and among doctors at the municipal, national, and international level. I have yet to see a visual timeline as good as this one that comprehensively explains what we know now about the early days. There have been excellent timelines put together by different institutions but I think a deeper dive, a more comprehensive dive, one that ideally links what happened in China, the US, and elsewhere would be an incredible resource for generations to come to better understand what went wrong and right globally and to have a better chance at fighting the next pandemic. 

I hope NYT or another capable source will make a timeline like this that looks critically at the decisions made everywhere. I remember many people comparing the Chinese response in the early days to Chernobyl and I think that seemed to be an apt comparison ‚Äî it may be interesting to analyze the degree to which that‚Äôs a fair analogue of what happened and to explore the ways in which a political system that firmly opposes dissent may also inhibit necessary transparency in the interest of stability over safety.",LePetitVingtieme1,2020-09-30T04:58:51Z

We have crap health, tons of big ag and conglomerates peddling TRASH as food. People slather a layer of sunscreen on before going out in the sun so they are not getting crucial Vitamin D. We are obese and disgustingly drugged with pharmaceuticals.

It is absolutely disgusting. And you don't know why America is having an issue ? A ""second wave"" happens because everyone is locked up inside and getting NO SUN, nobody is sharing germs to maintain social immunity! They are violating all these laws of social herd immunity and when people finally go out and are exposed they are already weakened. THE MEDICAL ""PROFESSIONALS"" ARE A JOKE.

Coronaviruses have been around for a long, long time. 

Doctors are still not sharing what people can do to boost their immunity - WHY NOT? Now we are going on month seven of BS and the doctors STILL DO NOT share any information about human health and how to boost our natural immunity. Nope, just masks, hand washing and social distancing. Are you KIDDING ME?

This is such an abject JOKE.",peterson553,2020-09-30T04:40:13Z

"I love Johnny Harris' deep dives, and this is an amazing video.  However, I think by not mentioning Taiwan, you've missed a big opportunity.  I'm not just saying that because I'm a Taiwanese American who currently live in Taiwan.  I'm saying it because Taiwan is the single country that dealt with this pandemic properly.  

By that I mean, despite being really close to China and has a very large percent of the population living and working inside China, Taiwan has kept the total number of COVID-19 cases to just 513 with 7 deaths with a population of over  23 million.  In fact, most of the cases were from people entering Taiwan through air travel, and were detected at the airport or in quarantine.  

And if you look at your lockdown map, you'd find that Taiwan isn't blue at all.  Taiwan prevented the pandemic from spreading without going into a lockdown, and Taiwan achieved this by forming a national team to make medical masks.  At first, back in January, regular civilians could only buy 2 masks per week.  Taiwan's heath officials communicated clearly the urgency of the situation and held daily briefings to instruct people how to wear the mask, and how to correctly stretch out the life of limited masks by keeping them dry.  By March we can order 9 masks online every 2 weeks.  Since everyone was wearing a medical mask when they are out in public, especially on public transportation and inside crowded buildings, there was no need for a lockdown.  The economy could keep on going as the mask effectively formed a herd immunity like defense for the public.

The health officials over here are all experienced medical professionals.  The vice-president at the time, Chen Chien-jen is a world leading epidemiologist.  The Taiwan CDC was well organized.  They put a mandatory 14 day quarantine in place for anyone who enters the country.  They did contact tracing and tracked down all the people that came into contacts with confirmed or suspected COVID patients.  If the world is to learn from this terrible pandemic, they definitely should learn from Taiwan.",Sean Su,2020-09-30T02:11:06Z

But this last week, we are having a state election in one of our state in Borneo and before that theres a political campaign.. and because of those few politician walking around the fish markets, supermarkets meeting people WITHOUT MASK.. now theres cases everywhere in that state alone reaching around 150 cases per day in that one state. The worst thing is that some people and also politician coming back from that state to Kuala Lumpur and didnt qurantine themselves are now spreading it to the whole peninsula of Malaysia. Now students going back to college are on hold and we may have to do the second lockdown.",Naim Ranizam,2020-09-30T02:05:05Z

"This video should be viewed by everyone, most especially those who are still on the fence of whom to cast their vote this November. I say those who are still on the fence because they are those persons whom have an open mind that can be made to understand and see the epic incompetence that has plagued this country under the inept leadership of Donald Trump. Those die forever Trumpers cannot be reached this late into the pandemic. They see the president as their guiding light and savior it seems and It really shocked me to learn how a significant portion of the populous can be easily bamboozled by this con man. The most powerful nation in the world has bungled the managing of this pandemic, long before it was classified as a pandemic. There is no excuse, why countries less developed than ours managed to effectively mitigate the further spread and effectuate treatment successfully than we have as a country. The result of having an incompetent, narcissistic president whose only interest was enrichment of himself, family and cronies for whom he has tapped to run our government - Clueless, No experience to speak off and a high turn around of the so called ""best people"" 

Wake up America! Our country is at stake, our way of life is at stake.

This president has time and time again saw co equal branch oversight as having little to no power of him - if we continue down this path we will see much of the country descend into lawlessness and anarchy. We will move from the mightiest nation on earth to that of the Philippines, North Korea, Iran and the likes.

We must remove the infection that has crippled the White House & this government before we can tackle the already immense loss and counting of american lives from this pandemic.

Wake up America! Wake up.

"@1:01 i don't want to down play that graph, but I'm curious. How many test was given in the USA vs EU per 1 million? EDIT: also little disappointed in NYT and Johnny. To blame this on Trump because his messaging wasn't clear is complete BS. First constitutionally he doesn't have the authority to implement a nationwide lockdown without congress. Even with 20/20 hindsight, I drought politically the Democrats would have gone along with Trumps lockdown proposal, until it was too late. Second lock down works if EVERYONE (that means 100% of the people) stays home, seeing everyone else freely ignoring the lockdown especially the BLM group, what is the point punishing myself by self imprisonment? Third, the worst response were hands down by the democratic leaders.

"Yeah, I don't buy that one man (the president) is responsible for ""all our problems."" There are state governments and county governments too. They set their own rules regarding Covid, it's not all in federal jurisdiction and control. The President doesn't control them like puppets...each plays their part. Most of the deaths occur in massive urban areas (LA, New York, Chicago, etc.) because there are more people concentrated in a small area. Does that mean the democrat governors and mayors are responsible for all the deaths in those areas? No, but people can't resist playing politics. Anything to get ""their guy"" in power.

I'd also like to know how many people died of natural causes in an average year, and how many died of natural causes during the covid pandemic. Because the majority of deaths seem to be in the 80+ age category...a lot of those people were going to die anyway within the next 5 to 10 years, so how does their death affect the rate of those who died from non-covid causes? Would be interesting to know. If the natural death rate plunges in the next few years, it would explain much.",Frank Zimmerman,2020-09-30T06:31:41Z

That difference was equal to about 100,000 or more deaths.   George Floyd was May 25th, kind've out of the scope of the discussion this video is trying to talk about.

"@cat lat They were cherry picking to make Trump look bad. They could have looked at other countries that were having worse problems. They could have mentioned that statistics are often dishonest and heavily influenced by governments (China is only one example). They could have mentioned the horrible failures and shortcomings of journalists and media, including the NYT. They could have taken some responsibility.
They mentioned Trump's shortcomings, but conveniently omitted his strong points, as well as their own and many others' failures. Unlike most journalists and media, including the NYT, and over their objections and opposition, he closed down flights from China early on.
Operation Warp Speed is another strong point. And there are many others as well.
There are data that attest to the successes. Where is the NYT in presenting the data? Where are those data in this video? Why are they missing?
Where are the viewpoints of Stanford's Dr. Scott Atlas? And his evidence supported by research from Stanford, Harvard, and Oxford? They are way ahead of the NYT, and far more honest and balanced.",Vive Viveka,2020-09-29T23:55:20Z
"@Vive Viveka ""They could have looked at other countries that were having worse problems. ""

should've told that to the Trump administration so they could learn from it but Trump undermined it severely for the first couple of months

""They could have mentioned that statistics are often dishonest and heavily influenced by governments (China is only one example).""

True, but the majority of the world didn't get accurate data until later on because of the lack of testing equipments but they did not suffer as terribly as the US.

 ""They could have mentioned the horrible failures and shortcomings of journalists and media, including the NYT. They could have taken some responsibility.""

True, the media and many other public figures undermined the coronavirus but Trump aswell perpetuated this notion so he isn't scot free either

""They mentioned Trump's shortcomings, but conveniently omitted his strong points, as well as their own and many others' failures. Unlike most journalists and media, including the NYT, and over their objections and opposition, he closed down flights from China early on.""

This is outta my depth so I'm gonna assume what you said is true but even so,  the Trump administration shouldve  closed the country from all foreigners earlier as Covid spreaded its wings all around the world and the source didnt' just come from China.

""Operation Warp Speed is another strong point. And there are many others as well.""

True

""There are data that attest to the successes. Where is the NYT in presenting the data? Where are those data in this video? Why are they missing?"" 

They pointed out the covid 19 rate  between Europe and the US? you can't just blindly say didn't put out any data.

Not really sure what you mean by the last paragraph

Overall, although I don't 100% blame Trump due to the hindsights that we have today and the protests that were going on, he and his administration do have to take the majority of the blame to prevent and contain the covid 19 infection. This is because he often went on briefings saying undermined the virus and saying 'masks are only voluntary' and how the virus "" will be gone by summer"". He's got to realise he has a lot of supporters that will follow him blindly and the anti- masks sentiments wouldve definitely decreased This also made the public treat the virus less seriously thus increasing their chances of getting infected - The BLM protests were also a factor that led to the increase in cases but they started in late may/ early June and the cases really started to skyrocket in March.",cat lat,2020-09-30T01:20:10Z

"You could have mentioned why cases are rising in Europe now as well (reopening of economies, like here in Germany) ... And how that is a much smaller problem now, then it was back then, when case numbers skyrocketed in the US: Because now European states are better prepared for new cases. We are able to reopen our economies by at the same time not risking as many lives as we would have done, acting like the US, since we by now had the time to acquire medical equipment. We simply had the time to prepare for the reopening, while the US tried to catch up to the ever rising case numbers.

I find that being quite important as an argument / explanation why the shrinking difference in case numbers doesn't actually mean that in Europe it's now similarly bad. You could have made that a little more clear.

"The answer is that the people in power (many many of them) failed to do their jobs, failed to do what the tax payers pay them to do and because of that 200,000 thousand people are now dead. People need to be hold accountable for this failure. Another problem is that there is a huge percentage of Americans who think that they know better than scientists and expert. People who think that experts are actively trying to harm them. People who are just so ignorant and selfish that they would rather have people die than to be convenient. That‚Äôs why we saw people going out to bars, going to parties, not wearing masks at the height of this pandemic.

"@Milo≈° ƒêuriƒá The second wave is strong, we are shutting down cafes and restaurants.

In USA, ~2% of the population has been tested, 53% recovered, 3% died. 
In France, ~0.8% of the population has been tested, 17% recovered, 6% died.
If you apply the proper calculation, USA is a better place compare to France.

So basically, France is supposed to have a healthier population with a better health care system than the USA, but numbers show that it is either false or irrelevant to such a pandemic. 

Even with those very sad numbers, how on earth would I blame President Macron since he tried so many ways to fight the virus, even with a very confusing and stupid communication.

Some countries however, refused to export  medical supplies, prioritising their own needs, and borders were closed within the Schengen Area. Very much a mixed bag.
 Europe's cases are starting to rise at an alarming rate. Mortality rates may be lower  as testing shows younger  people are contracting the disease, and it's less fatal for them as a group.

"Gilotopia 
Not so fast, Gilotopia!

Having lived through the whole Pandemic so far in NYC, the initial global hotspot for Coronavirus, this guidance was correct in the earliest days (Feb and early March) as surgical masks and other PPE was being (properly) allocated to frontline healthcare workers, first responders and other essential workers. At that time, there would have been truly limited utility to a mask requirement for the general public because there were so few spreaders out and about until the exponential curve of virus infection started in earnest.",Paul Glotzer,2020-09-30T00:28:37Z

He even said he rather lose than put the American People at risk. Trump rants at those poor people that Sleepy Joe can‚Äôt get crowds like I do. He brags and bashes all these people that have enough sense to do the right thing by the Americans. So, who‚Äôs the real loser here? It‚Äôs not traitor Trump. It‚Äôs the American People.

hi Johnny üëã,Wahidul Alam Srijon,2020-09-29T19:51:24Z
"But that is a narrative and a biased one. And untrue.
Even some parts of this video.
Early Jan briefing, the trade call between presidents and WEF Trump speech. 
Even if president was intimated about pandemic the information around the time was it is under control.
President Xi would never have acknowledged the outbreak on call with US president, especially when the call is about trade because US could leverage China's pandemic in trade negotiations
""Had sources in WHO"" wtf...If WHO hadn't downplayed the risk of global outbreak all countries would have prepared better. Instead, WHO told that it is not a big issue and there is absolutely no need to halt air travel.
Business as usual
Bryant's death was a big event at the time. So was grammy's. Even though almost everyone had knowledge of this epidemic in Wuhan but no one was ""focused"" because even media wasn't focused on it. NYT has very conveniently blamed people for being focused on grammy's but then why didn't they raise the incessant alarm on their channels and outlets??
US vs South Korea. Are we sure we are comparing the apples to apples? South Korea had an action plan which was tested earlier on MERS while US only had a theoretical playbook. Big difference. And if they are comparing it to South Korea, would NYT propose that US should have followed the same response? (South Korea (first response) did it without closing business, stay-at-home orders, or stricter measures like other countries)
Testing and tracing is a fundamental step. Of course, it is. Even a kindergarten kid can understand that but the testing strategy and implementation within the actual production constraints of testing kits and optimising in anticipation of incoming kits, lol. Even after getting every CEO from Fortune 500 to work on it, it would have felt impossible. 
The only short sightedness was that they ignored the second order effects of people travelling from China to Europe. The second order effect was people travelling from Europe to USA. Although they had banned China but hadn't banned European flights. That's where they faltered.
To be honest, by the time it was declared a pandemic in March everyone knew that the opportunity to contain it was gone. Now it was all about firefighting and hoping for the momentum to go away based on summer expectation.
Summer expectation did sound like a credible theory until it was proven otherwise.
Trump said ""be calm, it will go away""...what else is the president of US supposed to say? ""Panic, because no one in the world knows what to do and with the momentum this disease has gained, it is not stopping anytime soon""
I give that would be honest, but would that help the situation. The country would have been torn apart.
""Mayor did not take it seriously enough"" in tweet on 3rd March maybe because WHO did not consider it serious enough until 11th March, when Pandemic was declared.
[16:26] Amazing misrepresentation of data. Instead of saying entire US on 39% lockdown, instead show which counties were under strict lockdown and which areas weren't such as rural area because they did not need to be in the first place. US is a vast vast country and such spread over entire country statistic is trick not statistic. 
[16:47] If it were true that 4-6 week of very strict lockdown would have stopped it ""entirely"", India would have had miraculous recovery and escape. (Didn't happen, we tried)
[18:08] ""oblivious to science and public health advice"" maybe because you flunked your economics 101
By the end of April it was not just a health crisis it was also an economic crisis. Now the problem was trickier because you have to balance between short term goal (save lives) vs long term goal (save economy).
Hold your horses, before you say obvoously save lives > save economy. 
Not saving economy means letting millions or billions of life suffer in legacy of this crisis. It is not as easy a choice as it sounds.
The ending: The video never actually pinpointed exactly what was the reason behind the large gap which I was interested in. It just covered it up with a vague word ""incompetence"" because this is not an NYT opinion video summarising the last few months, it is an election campaign video with focus on November.

Now if you are wondering where to put me on Left vs Right spectrum, don't bother much just put me on the side of logic.
I am not here to comment on the US politics because none of my business, but strategy and logic, oh mama! That's my cup of tea.

Science did tell us quarantining was going to be have to be in waves until we got a vaccine and the faster you did it the faster you could lift it, but not sure the politicians can sell that and the direct economic hit it entails (esp. as lockdown means 85% salary covered by the State for companies that cannot work remote in my country).",Iamtop,2020-09-29T19:41:50Z

"I feel like too much of the blame for the rapid spread of the pandemic is placed on Trump. Yes, he did not take it seriously enough at first. However, it is the will of the people to take the virus seriously that impacts the spread of the virus. Additionally, going to get tested is only reliant on the will of the people. The government can't force you to get tested. It comes down to culture. American culture is very laissez-faire. In the video, Johnny compared the testing rates to South Korea. If I am betting on South Korea to obey the government more than Americans, I might as well put my entire life savings. Furthermore, The United States is not a true democracy. It is essentially a federation of 51 states that sacrifice some jurisdictions in order to protect classical liberal values and beliefs. The states do what they please in terms of most of their laws. We have seen it time and time again throughout history.  A prominent example being Alabama and Georgia outlawing abortion. The president cannot sign an executive order to mandate that everyone wear a mask. The United States definitely downplayed the virus at the beginning of the pandemic but I believe the main reasoning has to do with the will of the people to follow the governments recommendations.",Gabriel Benchimol,2020-09-29T19:35:23Z

"I think that Johnny is coming at this from the wrong angle.  Yes there were mistakes made on the front end, but the entire purpose of the US response has been purposefully misconstrued by journalists.  In the beginning, you‚Äôll remember that the point of staying indoors was to ‚Äúslow the spread‚Äù and prevent overwhelming hospitals.  Later on, this seems to have magically transformed into ‚Äúany case is a failure‚Äù.  Johnny makes a concession at the end of the video that Europe has seen a huge increase in cases despite their dramatic lockdowns.  To say that Trump has been a failure because there are cases is completely incorrect.  Once introduced into the population in a meaningful way, it is nearly impossible to eradicate, as we have seen with Europe.",Eli Mathieu,2020-09-29T19:18:12Z

He talks about European countries who lockdown and still got higher mortality rates but forgets to mention Sweden which didn't lockdown and has a lower mortality(more important indicator instead of cases). Fails to mention the nursing home scandal in New York, which alone represents tens of thousands of deaths. Compares a whole continent(Europe) with different fighting measures to a single country(US). Ignores states which didn't lockdown like South Dakota and still got a lower mortality rate than lockdown states. Again, California, Texas and Florida mortality rate figures are nowhere near those of New York or New Jersey(cases ‚â† deaths).

I saw a few comments on him being a leftist now working for a leftist corporation. Perhaps he is, perhaps NYT also is, but in investigative journalism facts prevail over political views, and he has proven throughout the years to be interested in the truth, in numbers and the reality of situations.

"I don't know Johnny. Back in January I thought that we'd be the hardest hit of any western country, we even considered going to my wife's family's home in Europe. 

Our healthcare system is profit driven so if people have to pay for treatment they won't go, we have a culture of working sick because we don't have sick pay, we have such a nonexistence safety net that people who lost their jobs due to the stay at home orders wouldn't or couldn't follow them. 

I think that even if we had a president who took this seriously we still would have been worse than the EU or most other countries, because our government might have theoretically been the best prepared but our citizens are not supported enough to be prepared.",Alex,2020-09-29T17:53:58Z

but.
at 4:55  that reporter said that China was indeed concealing  information but, somehow, we (who is 'we'?) had channels inside China and the WHO to know what was really happening.... sorry mate, but those 2 sentences make you not trustworthy . 
so how do you trust any report from these channels? how do you trust Xi Jingping when  Beijing told WHO there is nothing to worry? how do you trust WHO? 
how do you trust the so called test kit coming from China? 

The whole focus of this ""Opinion piece"" (so it is not journalism, it seems) was to tell people how America faced the covid 19 (tw, it's not a plague guys, numbers are not so high fortunately, please stop instilling fear on people s mind)
but
 Why not mentioning how each single State in the US handled the situation?  What about  Fauci and his team?  why not mentioning how allowing all those protests was potentially dangerous? I dont see any numbers when it comes to test, people positive and death from covid19.  Also you cant compare USA and Europe. 1. way moooore chinese people travel to and from US. 2. How do I know numbers from each single European countries are accurate?

"I also don't think Americans think collectively but instead more individually which is disastrous in a pandemic, that's the difference between Asia and the US for example.",HxH Killua,2020-09-29T21:09:53Z
Yes i agree and also something you have to consider is the mentality of the countries. In the USA many people think about them first and their personal loss and gain. Whereas in many European countries the mentality is that if my sorunding is good I am good and I have to do everything I can to make it good for my community and without them I will fail. Because the team player mentality many people where more willing to take it seriously and do everything they can but still think critically. But in the US many concentrated on them self and there was no United way to attack the virus and the leader played it down. That way it just was not an issue for them.,conni,2020-09-29T21:41:19Z
"I agree.  I had a bad feeling about this from the beginning.  There's a lot I love about America, but there's a lot that needs to be improved, too.  I've survived some nasty diseases during my life (Yersinia pestis and encephalopathic viral hemorrhagic fever, for instance) and I've been in real, actual quarantine (you know, the kind where the room is negative-air-pressure and they lock the door from the outside) so I took this pandemic deadly seriously -- even before our city locked down.  

I stayed inside till almost the end of May -- I literally didn't go ANYWHERE.  I lived on canned and dry food, and never went further than our back yard (and then only to take out this tiny dog).  I didn't even visit my friend who lives two blocks away.

But even in an important and benevolent ""quarantine"" like our city was attempting to do, I knew there'd be lots of people who just wouldn't follow it.  I think it's the one bad thing about our American love of Freedom -- too many people don't understand that if we'd only locked down hard in the beginning, we could've gotten past this and reopened sooner, and saved thousands of lives.

I still sometimes see people online who think Covid19 is no worse than the annual flu, just because it didn't hit their town very hard.ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",zxy atiywariii,2020-09-30T05:55:03Z

I suspect that even if the response had been swifter and guidelines more strict, America would have seen a disproportionate number of people simply ignoring and rebelling. The prevalence of alternative media sources that regularly flirt with conspiracy theory and the influence they have on the Western public should *stop* being ignored by mainstream publications like the NY Times, because that feeds into the problem.

"""and more so on the general American public's explosive distrust of media and authority""

This mistrust was bred by leaders. Conservative media cannot hold ground on a number of topics anymore, global climate change, the pandemic, etc... So what do they do to relieve the growing shame and doubt of their viewership? They lie. They lie and discredit expertise, facts, scientists. But they do it so selectively and dishonestly that now many regular americans don't know who to trust. All because right-wing media cannot have good-faith debate. They chose to lie, to enrage, and to divide. 30 years of Rush Limbaugh, 20 of Fox News... Now we pay the price for all the deception.",Rakanishu2,2020-09-29T18:01:29Z

"Agreed that distrust in the media is also an issue but the failure of the federal government to send a unified message to the people is more problematic. A small (but still good) example of this is Hong Kong. The government there is not trusted by most and the media has become more and more divided in their political leanings (pro- or anti-government). This has resulted in people becoming more selective about which news sources they deem trustworthy. However, the government came out with a unified message which was supported by the city's health experts and all news outlets reported the same stance regardless of their political leanings. So far, they've done a good job tackling the cases.",Sandra Pun,2020-09-29T18:32:12Z

"It's interesting how the US bungling of COVID while other countries did better serves as a representation of a more general phenomenon, namely: the US pioneers some idea (space travel, climate action, in this case pandemic preparedness, etc), then other countries surpass us because we become too bogged down in our own grandeur.

"I'm so sick of this Anti-American rhetoric when it come to COVID. Could America had prepared better? Of course it could have, but that's not who we are. We put billions of dollars in responding to natural disasters, but relatively little in preventing them. We are a reactionary society. We always have been.

This feels a lot like a Vox video and I'm not complaining,kaiplue,2020-09-29T17:31:11Z
"It‚Äôs more a story of how New York got so widely infected in the beginning. Everything else is because we slowed it down and it made its way throughout the country slowly as we increased testing. Then protests happened and it blew up. Now there are places throughout the country that have had little to no cases who are no experiencing a rise as the rest of the country decreases. The nature of this virus is clear no everyone is highly contagious but some people are extremely contagious. If next to no one in a population has had it then it really is only a matter of time before it spreads through. Good news is that because not everyone spreads at the same rate so once it makes it way through a population when combined with masks, good hygiene, and social distancing then cases drop dramatically.  So I‚Äôm not too sure what you feel government is or was supposed to do differently. Guidance was given. Resources were given. Production of equipment was ramped up as high as possible and distributed as fast as possible. The closest criticism you could find was a delay in large scale testing which during a lock down isn‚Äôt crucial outside of hospitals and first responders. At this point it comes down to compliance with guidelines and how many people in a given population have the antibodies.",talljohn5350,2020-09-29T17:31:03Z

"Conflating cases will serious illness and death is nonsense.  The US is a huge country, so it has ONE wave of hospitalizations/deaths in each state, just spread over time (part of flattening the curve, which delays rather than cures).  A second wave may come this winter (starting soon, October is typical) as we head back indoors and the seasonality affect kicks in.

The second nonsense is believing early models as if they were science, and then believing science gets policy right, too.  Science created nuclear fission; governments created a bomb.  Total isolation will indeed ""solve"" Covid for the duration of the isolation, but at a cost nobody in their right mind would support, well, unless you are the NY Times and pretend fearmongering is good medicine and science.

How did sending sick old people back into nursing homes work out?  How did all those ventilators work out?  How did the FDA/CDC-mandated testing work out?  How did all those ""field hospitals"" work out?  How did telling us not to wear masks work out?  How did the lockdowns and other tyrannies work out?

how do you trust the so called test kit coming from China? 

The whole focus of this ""Opinion piece"" (so it is not journalism, it seems) was to tell people how America faced the covid 19 (tw, it's not a plague guys, numbers are not so high fortunately, please stop instilling fear on people s mind)
but
 Why not mentioning how each single State in the US handled the situation?  What about  Fauci and his team?  why not mentioning how allowing all those protests was potentially dangerous? I dont see any numbers when it comes to test, people positive and death from covid19.  Also you cant compare USA and Europe. 1. way moooore chinese people travel to and from US. 2. How do I know numbers from each single European countries are accurate?

"Sure the Government has made a few mistakes here in India. But India's response to this Pandemic was never as terrible as the US's. Even Johnny stresses @ 16:33 how important the complete shutdown was. In India, the Government did that, when the total cases were under 1000 ! That really helped India in fighting the virus. But as the country slowly started unlocking, the cases started to rise.
We can not blame the Government solely for this. The government cannot come to each and every 1.3 billion citizens and force them to wear masks and wash hands. It was the irresponsible behavior of people that accelerated the spread of virus here in India.
